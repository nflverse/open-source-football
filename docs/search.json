      "contents": "\nWhat Seb says\nAt the beginning of 2020 I decided to dive into NFL Analytics and started to follow\nthe big accounts (within the community) on Twitter.\nI learned there was this R package nflscrapR and\nstarted to learn R and the NFL play-by-play data. Very quickly I got the urge\nto make some plots with R and post them on Twitter, because I wanted to hear\nwhat the people who know about it have to say. The plots were well received and\nI was getting requests to publish the related code. I did that and got a lot of\npositive feedback.\nAt some point one thing led to another and before I knew it I developed\nnflfastR together with\nBen Baldwin.\nMost of my previously released code didn’t work after that and I had to decide\nwhether to just remove the code or rebuild the whole thing.\nThis website is the result but with a big improvement:\nvery intelligent people from the community agreed to publish their code as well.\nAnd this is the place where I want to centralize all these things.\nWhat Ben says\nThe existence of open-source packages like nflscrapR\nand nflfastR along with people’s willingness\nto share code has made NFL analytics Twitter a great place to learn from each other.\nHowever, the nature of Twitter makes it hard to find old posts, and I often have\na hard time remembering where I saw something.\nThe hope is that this will serve as a resource for others.\nContributors\nThis section has been moved.\nDesign\nThis website is built with Distill for R Markdown.\nIt uses a custom Cascading Style Sheet (css) heavily borrowed from Matt\nWorthington as suggested by the incredible\nhelpful Tom Mock.\nThe logo was\ncontributed by Jonathan Piech.\n\n\n\n",

To achieve this, we need volunteers\nwho are willing to make a contribution.\nArticles posted on Open Source Football are authored using Distill for R\nMarkdown. If you would like to contribute,\nyou’ll need to have installed R and R Markdown. However, this does not\nmean that are limited exclusively to R code because R Markdown\nsupports many other languages as well!\nYou’ll need R and R Markdown to create the post and the formal structure but the\nmost important thing - your code and its output - can be anything compatible with R\n(please see Ben’s python contributing example).\nThis guide is intended to help all contributors prepare articles for\npublishing. If you have questions or think something is unclear or wrong please create an\nissue and we will\nlook into it.\nBrief Overview\nHere is a very brief overview of what is needed. The next section will have much\nmore detail on each of these steps.\nThe steps below assume that\nyou have RStudio and git (I highly recommend Hadley’s\ngit section in “R packages”) installed.\nContributing to someone else’s package or project became much more convenient with the usethis pull request helpers. We will use these in the following sections, so please read the linked article.\nInstall the R packages you will need to contribute (Note the minimum version requirement of distill)\nFork the website repository to your GitHub (you’ll need a free account) and clone it to your local computer\nCreate a new branch\nCreate the new article (see the\nrepo for\nsome examples and check the Distill for R\nMarkdown website) and please don’t forget\nto add metadata and chunk options as discussed\nin the next section\nCommit all to your post related files\nSubmit the pull request and let us review your code https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#submit-pull-request\n(please see Push your work into your repo\nfor details what you should do to avoid merge conflicts)\nWith the last step we will be notified and will take a look at your article,\nsuggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it’s ready by merging it into\nthe main repository.\nMore Detailed Instructions\nBefore you start, don’t forget to read the article on usethis pull request helpers.\nInstall the packages\nInstall the packages distill, usethis and rmarkdown with\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"distill\", \"usethis\", \"rmarkdown\"))\n\n\nImportant!\nRendering of the site will fail or be incomplete if an outdated version of distill is installed, so please check if you have installed distill >= 1.0 by running\n\n\npaste0(\"You are running distill v\", utils::packageVersion(\"distill\"))\n\n[1] \"You are running distill v1.5\"\n\nFork and Clone the Repository\nThe “Fork” is your own copy of the Open Source Football Github Repository. You can clone it to get your own local copy. There are many ways to accomplish these two steps, but I highly recommend\n\n\nusethis::create_from_github(\"nflverse/open-source-football\")\n\n\nThis will fork the repo, clone it to your computer and open the project in a new RStudio session. Click here for more details.\nCreate a new Branch and Start Working\nThe process of contributing starts now by creating a new branch (please try to choose a descriptive name). It is good practice to make your changes in a new branch instead of the main branch, so please make sure not to skip this step.\n\n\nusethis::pr_init(branch = \"bens-apa-tiers\")\n\n\nClick here for more details.\nStart working on the post\nCreate the new article by running\n\n\ndistill::create_post(\"Title of your post\")\n\n\nThis will create a new folder in _posts and name it with the current date and\nyour chosen title. Additionally the RMarkdown file in which you will write your\npost will be opened automatically. It will look something like this\n\n\n\nWe need to tweak the metadata as well as the chunk setup a little bit in order\nfor the post to meet our expectations. Please have a look at example\nfile\nfor a little template.\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to write your post. Please see Distill for R\nMarkdown as well as some of the\nalready published posts.\nAnd if you feel like you need more information about R Markdown please feel free\nto check the R Markdown Cookbook.\nCommit your Changes in your Branch\nUsing git within RStudio is easy because you can do it graphically. However, it\ndoesn’t make sense to provide a ton of screenshots and text here. Instead I\nrecommend two sources:\nThe short one is happygitwithr.com\nThe detailed one is Hadley’s section\nCommit all files which are related to your post and go on with the last step.\nThere are 4 files not related to your post which may cause merge conflicts when you push\nthem without updating them before your pull request. To avoid this, please run the\nfollowing code right before you commit all your files:\n\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nflverse/open-source-football/master/_update_con_files.R\")\n\n\nIf you forget this step, you can still create the pull request and GitHub\nwill inform you of the conflicts. If there are conflicts, run the above line, then commit and\npush the updated files: docs/index.html, docs/index.xml, docs/posts/posts.json, and\ndocs/sitemap.xml.\nSubmit the Pull Request\nThe following code pushes any local changes of your code to GitHub and puts you in position to make your pull request:\n\n\nusethis::pr_push()\n\n\nThis launches a browser window with the prepared pull request on Github. You will have to click “Create pull request”, add some description, and finally submit it.\nClick here for more details.\nNow you are done. We will start reviewing your pull request and make sure to publish it. Thanks for your contribution!\n\n\n\n",
