      "contents": "\nWhat Seb says\nAt the beginning of 2020 I decided to dive into NFL Analytics and started to follow the big accounts (within the community) on Twitter.\nI learned there was this R package nflscrapR and started to learn R and the NFL play-by-play data. Very quickly I got the urge to make some plots with R and post them on Twitter, because I wanted to hear what the people who know about it have to say. The plots were well received and I was getting requests to publish the related code. I did that and got a lot of positive feedback.\nAt some point one thing led to another and before I knew it I developed nflfastR together with Ben Baldwin. Most of my previously released code didn’t work after that and I had to decide whether to just remove the code or rebuild the whole thing.\nThis website is the result but with a big improvement: very intelligent people from the community agreed to publish their code as well. And this is the place where I want to centralize all these things.\nWhat Ben says\nThe existence of open-source packages like nflscrapR and nflfastR along with people’s willingness to share code has made NFL analytics Twitter a great place to learn from each other. However, the nature of Twitter makes it hard to find old posts, and I often have a hard time remembering where I saw something.\nThe hope is that this will serve as a resource for others.\nContributors\nThis section has been moved.\nDesign\nThis website is built with Distill for R Markdown. It uses a custom Cascading Style Sheet (css) heavily borrowed from Matt Worthington as suggested by the incredible helpful Tom Mock.\nThe logo was contributed by Jonathan Piech.\n\n\n\n",

To achieve this we need volunteers who are willing to make a contribution.\nArticles posted on Open Source Football are authored using Distill for R Markdown. If you would like to contribute you’ll have to have installed R and R Markdown. However, this expressly does not mean that we want to limit ourselves exclusively to R code because R Markdown supports many other languages as well! You’ll need R and R Markdown to create the post and the formal structure but the most important thing - your code and it’s output - can be anything you want (please see Ben’s python contributing example).\nThis guide is intended to help all contributors to get their articles ready for publishing. Since all of this is very new it’s a work in progress and if I see typical problems I will update this site with the corresponding solutions. If you have questions or think something is unclear or wrong please create an issue and I will look into it.\nStep by Step Overview\nIf you are willing to contribute you will have to follow the below steps (we will discuss some steps more detailed in the next section). Please note we assume that you have RStudio and git (I highly recommend Hadley’s git section in “R packages”) installed.\nInstall the R packages you will need to contribute (Note the minimum version requirement of ‘distill’)\nCreate a copy of the website repo to your GitHub (you’ll need a free account)\nLoad it into a new RStudio project and start working in a new branch\nCreate the new article (see the repo for some examples and check the Distill for R Markdown website) and please don’t forget to add metadata and chunk options like suggested in the next section\nCommit all to your post related files and push them into the new branch in your GitHub repo (please see Push your work into your repo for details what you should do to avoid merge conflicts)\nVisit your repo and create a pull request to merge your post into the open-source-football repo\nWith the last step we will be notified and will take a look at your article, suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it’s ready by merging it into the main repo.\nMore Detailed Instruction\nInstall the packages\nInstall the packages distill and rmarkdown with\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"distill\", \"rmarkdown\"))\n\n\n\nImportant! Rendering of the site will fail or be incomplete if an outdated version of distill is installed, so please check if you have installed distill >= 1.0 by running\n\n\npaste0(\"You are running distill v\", utils::packageVersion(\"distill\"))\n\n\n[1] \"You are running distill v1.2\"\n\nFork the repo\nLogin to your GitHub account, view the website repo and fork it by clicking the “Fork” button. The current version of the repo will be copied into your GitHub.\n\n\n\nCreate a new branch within your repo and try to choose a descriptive name\n\n\n\nImport the repo into a RStudio Project\nCopy the web url of the new repo into your clipboard\n\n\n\nIn RStudio choose Create a Project > Version Control > Git, paste the Repository URL from above and click “Create Project”. The whole thing will be downloaded and the project opened.\nImportant: Make sure you switch into your newly created branch from the previous section!\nFor further information please visit happygitwithr.com.\n\n\n\nStart working on the post\nCreate the new article by running\n\n\ndistill::create_post(\"Title of your post\")\n\n\n\nThis will create a new folder in _posts and name it with the current date and your chosen title. Additionally the RMarkdown file in which you will write your post will be opened automatically. It will look something like this\n\n\n\nWe need to tweak the metadata as well as the chunk setup a little bit in order for the post to meet our expectations. Please have a look at example file for a little template.\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to write your post. Please see Distill for R Markdown as well as some of the already published posts. And if you feel like you need more information about R Markdown please feel free to check the R Markdown Cookbook.\nPush your work into your repo\nUsing git within RStudio is easy because you can do it graphically. However, it doesn’t make sense to provide a ton of screenshots and text here. Instead I recommend two sources:\nThe short one is happygitwithr.com\nThe detailed one is Hadley’s section\nCommit all files which are related to your post and go on with the last step. There are 4 files not related to your post causing merge conflicts when you push them without updating them before your pull request. To avoid this please run the following code right before you commit all your files.\n\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrcaseb/open-source-football/master/_update_con_files.R\")\n\n\n\nNever mind if you forget that. You can create the pull request anyway and GitHub will inform you if there are conflicts. Just run the above lines and commit and push the updated files docs/index.html, docs/index.xml, docs/posts/posts.json, docs/sitemap.xml.\nCreate the Pull Request\nTo create the Pull Request visit your GitHub repo and you will notice a banner indicating that you’ve recently pushed a new branch and that you can “compare & pull request”. Follow the steps for creating a pull request from a fork and you are finally done.\n\n\n\n",
