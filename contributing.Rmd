## Preface

The key idea of Open Source Football is to make football related analysis and
the corresponding code publicly available. To achieve this we need volunteers 
who are willing to make a contribution.

Articles posted on Open Source Football are authored using [Distill for R 
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill). If you would like to contribute
you'll have to have installed R and R Markdown. However, this expressly **does not 
mean that we want to limit ourselves exclusively to R code** because R Markdown 
[supports many other languages as well](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/other-languages.html)!
You'll need R and R Markdown to create the post and the formal structure but the 
most important thing - your code and it's output - can be anything you want
(please see [Ben's python contributing example](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-08-20-python-contributing-example/)).

This guide is intended to help all contributors to get their articles ready for
publishing. Since all of this is very new it's a work in progress and if I see 
typical problems I will update this site with the corresponding solutions. If 
you have questions or think something is unclear or wrong please [create an
issue](https://github.com/nflverse/open-source-football/issues/new) and I will
look into it.

## Step by Step Overview

If you are willing to contribute you will have to follow the below steps (we will
discuss some steps more detailed in the next section). Please note we assume that
you have [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) and git (I highly recommend [Hadley's
git section](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) in "R packages") installed. 

Contributing to someone else’s package or project became much more convenient with the [usethis pull request helpers](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html). We will use these in the following sections, so please read the linked article. 

1. Install the R packages you will need to contribute (**Note the minimum version requirement of 'distill'**)
1. [Fork the website repository to your GitHub (you'll need a free account) and clone it to your local computer](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#fork-and-clone)
1. [Create a new branch](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#branch-then-make-your-change)
1. Create the new article (see [the 
repo](https://github.com/nflverse/open-source-football/tree/master/_posts) for 
some examples and check the [Distill for R 
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) website) and please don't forget
to add [metadata and chunk options](#start-working-on-the-post) like suggested
in the next section
1. Commit all to your post related files
1. Submit the pull request and let us review your code https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#submit-pull-request
(please see [Push your work into your repo](#push-your-work-into-your-repo)
for details what you should do to **avoid merge conflicts**)

With the last step we will be notified and will take a look at your article, 
suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it’s ready by merging it into
the main repository.

## More Detailed Instruction

Before you start, don't forget to read the article on [usethis pull request helpers](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html). 

### Install the packages

Install the packages `distill`, `usethis` and `rmarkdown` with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("distill", "usethis", "rmarkdown"))
```

**Important!**
Rendering of the site will fail or be incomplete if an outdated version of `distill` is installed, so please check if you have installed `distill >= 1.0` by running

```{r, eval=TRUE}
paste0("You are running distill v", utils::packageVersion("distill"))
```

### Fork and Clone the Repository

The "Fork" is your own copy of the Open Source Football Github Repository. You can clone it to get your own local copy. There are many ways to accomplish these two steps, but I highly recommend

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_from_github("nflverse/open-source-football")
```

This will fork the repo, clone it to your computer and open the project in a new RStudio session. [Click here for more details](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#fork-and-clone). 

### Create a new Branch and Start Working

The process of contributing starts now by creating a new branch (please try to choose a descriptive name). It is good practice to make your changes in a new branch instead of the main branch, so please make sure not to skip this step.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::pr_init(branch = "bens-apa-tiers")
```

[Click here for more details](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#branch-then-make-your-change).

### Start working on the post

Create the new article by running

```{r, eval=FALSE}
distill::create_post("Title of your post")
```

This will create a new folder in `_posts` and name it with the current date and
your chosen title. Additionally the RMarkdown file in which you will write your 
post will be opened automatically. It will look something like this

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38586519/90627998-1dcb1980-e21d-11ea-8ea9-e307f81087c4.png")
```

We need to tweak the metadata as well as the chunk setup a little bit in order
for the post to meet our expectations. Please have a look at [example 
file](https://github.com/nflverse/open-source-football/blob/master/_sample_meta_and_options.Rmd) 
for a little template. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38586519/90628632-3e47a380-e21e-11ea-9bae-a01ac6720026.png")
```

Now you are ready to write your post. Please see [Distill for R 
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) as well as some of [the 
already published posts](https://github.com/nflverse/open-source-football/tree/master/_posts).
And if you feel like you need more information about R Markdown please feel free
to check the [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/).

### Commit your Changes in your Branch

Using git within RStudio is easy because you can do it graphically. However, it 
doesn't make sense to provide a ton of screenshots and text here. Instead I 
recommend two sources:

* The short one is [happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
* The detailed one is [Hadley's section](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)

Commit all files **which are related to your post** and go on with the last step.
There are 4 files not related to your post causing merge conflicts when you push
them without updating them before your pull request. To avoid this please run the
following code right before you commit all your files.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nflverse/open-source-football/master/_update_con_files.R")
```

Never mind if you forget that. You can create the pull request anyway and GitHub
will inform you if there are conflicts. Just run the above lines and commit and 
push the updated files `docs/index.html`, `docs/index.xml`, `docs/posts/posts.json`,
`docs/sitemap.xml`.


### Submit the Pull Request

The following code pushes the local change to your copy of praise on GitHub and puts you in position to make your pull request

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::pr_push()
```

This launches a browser window with the prepared pull request on Github. **You will have to click "Create pull request"**, add some description and finally submit it.
[Click here for more details](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#submit-pull-request).

Now you are done. We will start reviewing your pull request and make sure to publish it. Thanks for your contribution!
