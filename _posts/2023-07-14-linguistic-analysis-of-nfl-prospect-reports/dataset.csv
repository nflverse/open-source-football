Jadeveon Clowney,"A physical specimen with a rare size-speed combination, Clowney was not as impactful as a junior while playing through injuries and being forced to deal with opposing offenses that fully accounted for him with extra chip protection. Was a 20-year-old junior affected by turnover on the defensive coaching staff. Could benefit tremendously from a stable positional coach and strong, veteran mentor on the defensive line who will hold him accountable, show him the way and serve as a fatherly figure. Is one of the most unique talents in the draft and could easily be a double-digit sack producer in the pros from either end. Is every bit worthy of the first overall pick -- will immediately upgrade a defensive line and improve the production of those around him.",7.5,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jadeveon-clowney/3200434c-4f53-5848-cd48-3846b85c634d
Sammy Watkins,"A legitimate No. 1-caliber receiver who stepped onto the field as a true freshman and made an immediate, game-changing impact. Was slowed by injuries as a sophomore, but responded with a strong junior season and capped his career as one of the most impactful receivers in school history. Has rare speed, soft hands and the big-play ability to challenge NFL defensive backs as a rookie. A top-10 cinch.",7.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sammy-watkins/32005741-5427-0480-637c-854aaf86ba0e
Anthony Barr,"A highly disruptive, athletic specimen with the pass-rush potential to effortlessly emerge as a double-digit sack producer. Is far from a finished product and his best football is still ahead of him, yet he plays the game with more of an offensive temperament and could require some patience. Is the type of rare athlete that could even contribute as an offensive playmaker once he learns to grasp defensive concepts and the game slows down for him. A top-10 talent.",7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-barr/32004241-5255-0678-26cd-58fd8ece815f
Khalil Mack,"A havoc-wreaking rush linebacker with the burst and acceleration to excel as a right defensive end in a ""40"" front, Mack has demonstrated the instincts, toughness, athletic ability and explosive power to line up at any linebacker position in an even or odd front and factor readily. Is a four-year starter who made an immediate impact upon his arrival and is well primed for the NFL game. Looks every bit the part, comes from a humble, grounded family and offers the full package to become an impact performer in the pros.",7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/khalil-mack/32004d41-4332-5122-ef2d-7d43941a5ee7
Jake Matthews,"Smart, tough, versatile franchise left tackle capable of playing all five positions on the line. Can plug into a starting lineup immediately and will play a long time at a consistently high level. One of the safest picks in the draft, Matthews' best position might even be center.",7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-matthews/32004d41-5456-5555-1827-0d5d5e928f5d
C.J. Mosley,"Smart, instinctive, fast-flowing, every-down linebacker capable of manning any position in a ""40"" front or steering a defense from the weak side in a ""30"" front, where he starred for a national-championship defense as a junior and carried the Tide as a senior. Has the football temperament, desire and work habits to emerge as a tackling machine in the pros. Has Pro Bowl potential.",7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c-j-mosley/32004d4f-5336-1252-5a5a-3a4856095815
Greg Robinson,"Big, strong, athletic, overpowering left tackle with the raw potential to become a premiere, franchise left tackle. Is only a third-year sophomore and two-year starter and still must improve his hand use, footwork and technique. However, he is undeniably gifted and capable of walking into a starting-left-tackle job in the pros and paving the way in the run game.",7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/greg-robinson/3200524f-4250-1818-202c-12ce32d97431
Kelvin Benjamin,"A monster-sized, intimidating, big-play receiver, Benjamin has the overall strength, length and wide catching radius that will demand extra coverage be rolled his way. Showed continual improvement, is still growing into the position, and possesses the traits to become a legitimate No. 1 receiver. A very intriguing mismatch weapon with ascending talent.",6.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kelvin-benjamin/32004245-4e15-0538-7acf-a6a8f1fabfd0
Blake Bortles,"Big, athletic, ascending quarterback with enough arm talent and intangibles to develop into a franchise starter. Is not yet a finished product and scouts' opinions vary on his ceiling, but elements of Bortles‚Äô skill set compare to some of the best in the game today, and his best football is ahead of him.",6.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/blake-bortles/3200424f-5265-0964-4a57-fb0d82ae917e
Teddy Bridgewater,"A calculated, football-smart, precision-matchup rhythm passer, Bridgewater would be best suited entering a warm-weather or dome environment such as those most common in the South divisions. Would stand to benefit heavily from operating a short, dink-and-dunk rhythm passing game. Compensates for a lack of elite arm talent and prototype measureables with the intangibles and football intelligence that could elevate the other 52 players around him. Instinctive passer with the laser-beam determination to become a Pro Bowl-caliber passer in the right system.",6.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/teddy-bridgewater/32004252-4912-9168-84fe-1a998a0eb85b
Eric Ebron,"Highly athletic, highly productive ""F"" tight end dripping with upside and mismatch capability. Ebron might not be in the ""freak"" category, but his speed, movement skills, hands and run-after-catch skill puts him in the next tier, as he has ample ability to be a playmaker at the next level.",6.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-ebron/32004542-5247-4619-e13a-2be177a1a622
Justin Gilbert,"A big, fast, athletic, man-cover corner capable of locking down receivers and creating big plays in the return game. Is the most physically gifted cover man in this year's draft and has the athletic talent to walk into a starting job and match up with big receivers from Day One if he continues to work at his craft after a big payday and prepares like a pro.",6.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-gilbert/32004749-4c08-8998-ad37-f971b0da3316
Stephon Tuitt,"Hulking, long-armed, physically gifted defensive lineman with desirable size, strength, athleticism and versatility to appeal as a five-technique or as a defensive tackle or base end in a 4-3. Was not in peak condition for his junior season, but has disruptive upside.",6.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stephon-tuitt/32005455-4975-3113-1d2d-3d199a9c6901
Ha Ha Clinton-Dix,"Lean, athletic, physical, instinctive free safety with starter-caliber range, coverage skills and tackling ability. Was not an omnipresent ballhawk or violent eraser, but should step into a starting role right away and solidify the position.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ha-ha-clinton-dix/3200434c-4976-9272-34d2-426b96546040
Mike Evans,"A prep hoopster with shooting-guard size, Evans combined with Johnny Manziel to form one of the most dominant quarterback-receiver connections in the nation the last two seasons. He‚Äôs a big, physical, strong-handed, West Coast possession receiver with playmaking ability who projects as a No. 2 in the pros where he will make his money as a chain mover and red-zone target.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-evans/32004556-4153-4309-b2ed-6b8233f6fea5
Ra'Shede Hageman,"A raw, converted tight end with a basketball background, Hageman is a big, athletic, finesse three-technique with intriguing dimensions and movement skills who fits best in an aggressive, one-gap scheme where he could fire into gaps. Will probably be restricted to nickel pass-rush duty initially until the game slows down for him, but has impact potential if he ever figures it out. Is still maturing, having endured a harrowing childhood to get to where he is today, and would be best served landing in a structured environment with veteran mentorship. Classic boom-or-bust prospect.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ra-shede-hageman/32004841-4715-2196-45d9-cf4f935c3ee8
Carlos Hyde,"A big, strong, powerful, NFL feature back who carried the Buckeyes' offense as a senior and proved he can be a workhorse. Solid all-around, chunk runner well-built for the physicality of the AFC North.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carlos-hyde/32004859-4440-2541-ab5b-a4d6828a3fe3
Demarcus Lawrence,"A loose, explosive, long-limbed athlete, Lawrence consistently pressurizes the edge and harasses quarterbacks. His pass-rushing ability rates among the best in this year‚Äôs class, and he holds mass appeal. Lacks ideal stoutness at the point of attack, but could thrive as a 4-3 right end or 3-4 rush linebacker, and should contribute readily on passing downs.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demarcus-lawrence/32004c41-5728-2118-edab-498f27240b6f
Marqise Lee,"An extremely motivated, dynamic, playmaking receiver, Lee's junior season was plagued by shoulder, knee and leg injuries and a revolving door at head coach, where he cycled through three. Showed all the traits desired in a No. 1 receiver early in his career and has overcome a lot of adversity in his life to get to this point.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marqise-lee/32004c45-4546-6282-baae-dd48c42a2f01
Taylor Lewan,"An experienced, finesse left tackle with the length, agility and temperament to hold down a starting job for a long time. Is nuanced in pass protection and would fit best in a slide-lateral movement, bucket-stepping, zone-based blocking scheme. Similar in mold to Patriots 2011 17th overall selection Nate Solder.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taylor-lewan/32004c45-5700-2883-b622-ba38489a4e2c
Calvin Pryor,"A big, physical, hammering run defender brings an enforcer mentality to the box and an intimidating, punishing presence to the back end. Is arguably the most violent hitter in this year's draft class and should make his presence felt readily in the pros.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/calvin-pryor/32005052-5943-2541-3b2b-d56a7e7e55ce
Bradley Roby,"Smallish, quick-twitch, speedy, physical cornerback with an intriguing combination of urgent athleticism, ball skills, tackling ability and scheme versatility. Appeals to zone and man teams, should be able to contribute readily as nickel slot defender and special-teams contributor and has a ceiling as a No. 2.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bradley-roby/3200524f-4280-5749-9652-a615a0a1a70a
Ryan Shazier,"The Big Ten's leading tackler, Shazier flies around the field and his unique athletic ability stands out. Offers a tremendous combination of speed, tackling and coverage skills to become a playmaker as a run-and-hit 4-3 Will or perhaps a 3-4 weakside 'backer if protected by a block-occupying nose tackle. Value is increased by the fact that he will not have to come off the field.",6.7,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-shazier/32005348-4182-2597-c630-4a35458d1ebc
Davante Adams,"A long-limbed, sure-handed possession receiver with starter-caliber, positional traits. Lacks top-end speed and strength. As a 21-year-old, third-year sophomore entering the draft early, is still growing into his body and developing core strength. A poor man's Michael Crabtree, Adams possesses very intriguing upside to be groomed.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davante-adams/32004144-4121-8591-4d26-4c0ac739af41
Odell Beckham Jr.,"Talented, competitive, productive, inconsistent college split end who projects as a flanker or slot receiver in the pros, where a creative offensive coordinator can take advantage of his run-after-catch skills. Could be a productive No. 3 option with added value as a kick returner.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/odell-beckham-jr/32004245-4357-3252-264b-1da3e93d2745
Darqueze Dennard,"Big, strong, athletic, instinctive press-man corner who elevated his game as a senior. Is deceptively fast and has the desirable size to match up with big receivers.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darqueze-dennard/32004445-4e09-5585-b09c-1ac0b8a3689f
Gabe Jackson,"Big, thickly built, relatively polished blocker who brings a steadying presence to the interior offensive line. Dependability and effectiveness blocking for pass and run combined with sterling intangibles, including football intelligence, make him capable of starting as a rookie and holding down a position for years to come.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gabe-jackson/32004a41-4317-8303-e9e6-8ce1a32211aa
Johnny Manziel,"A very unique, run-around, ad-lib, sandlot-style quarterback who consistently won games playing a brand of fast-paced, jailbreak football that often goes off script and can be difficult both to game plan with and against. Is most comfortable on the move outside the pocket where he can find open throwing lanes and see the field and will command mush rush and extra spy defenders. Has defied the odds and proven to be a great college-system quarterback, but still must prove he is willing to work to be great, adjust his hard-partying, Hollywood lifestyle and be able to inspire his teammates by more than his playmaking ability. Overall character, leadership ability and work habits will define his NFL career. Rare competitiveness and third-down efficiency could carry him a long way, yet he will be challenged to avoid a Ryan Leaf-like, crash-and-burn scenario if he does not settle down and mature. A high-risk, high-reward pick, Manziel stands to benefit from entering the NFL at a time when moving pockets are trending.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/johnny-manziel/32004d41-4e79-4607-5b0c-d1ab80db11cf
Zack Martin,"Athletic, smart, competitive, dependable college left tackle whose length dictates a move inside, where he has plug-and-play ability in a zone-blocking scheme. One of the cleanest prospects in this year‚Äôs draft.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zack-martin/32004d41-5277-1661-22a7-85637246c769
Louis Nix,"Despite standing to benefit from a more dominant senior season in South Bend, Nix, who already graduated, opted to forgo his final year of eligibility in order to provide for 13 siblings. He does not enter the NFL with momentum, having coped with knee tendinitis before season-ending surgery to repair a torn left meniscus, and too often his gregarious personality and media hype overshadowed his performance. However, if the massive interior defender taps into his power more consistently, Nix has ample mass, strength and athleticism to anchor a ""30"" front as a space-eating, block-occupying run stuffer.",6.4,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/louis-nix/32004e49-5850-0878-bb1b-70ee345f65e5
Derek Carr,"Athletic, tough, instinctive, strong-armed, highly competitive quarterback who will impress in workouts, interviews and on the board. Elevated the Fresno State program and profiles like a gunslinger, though he‚Äôd be better served in the long run honing his game-management skills. Will be a starter sooner rather than later and the degree to which he‚Äôs able to make those around him better will determine his ceiling.",6.3,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derek-carr/32004341-5235-8797-3b9a-0d2711c0bc27
Brandin Cooks,"Short, speedy, nifty-footed receiver who was unaffected by the departure of Steelers 2013 third-rounder Markus Wheaton, establishing himself as a playmaker in his own right by leading the nation with 133 yards per contest as a junior. Projects as a useful slot receiver with run-after-catch ability and some utility as an outside receiver.",6.3,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandin-cooks/3200434f-4f29-9382-29e1-70020b0a09be
Jeremy Hill,"Big, thickly built, athletic slasher with an overinflated sense of his abilities and character red flags, which could cause some teams to shy away. Fits best in a downhill scheme and has potential to be a 20-carry back in the NFL, but must run to his size more consistently and prove his unstable behavior is a thing of the past.",6.3,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-hill/32004849-4c40-7410-a042-2e41fafcc5fc
Donte Moncrief,"Big, physically gifted ‚ÄúX‚Äù receiver with deep speed, ‚Äúabove-the-rim‚Äù potential and playmaking ability. Has a ceiling as a No. 1 or No. 2 in a vertical passing offense, and his best football is in front him. Likely to elevate his stock at the combine and in workouts.",6.3,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donte-moncrief/32004d4f-4e11-7004-12bd-2d2a3d30b214
Ka'Deem Carey,"Highly productive, hard-charging slasher who runs more competitively than he does powerfully and picks up yardage in chunks. Has some first-round traits and is one of the most instinctive runners in this year's draft class, though his stock could be affected by off-the-field troubles.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ka-deem-carey/32004341-5208-5888-3de8-1d9f4ab88ea4
Kony Ealy,"Big, athletic, ascending, pass-rush talent with the size, burst and flexibility to pressurize the edge as a right defensive end. Is not a finished product, particularly as a run defender, but should only become more disruptive as his strength, technique and savvy catch up with his natural physical ability. Could also draw looks as a 3-4 rush linebacker.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kony-ealy/32004541-4c78-4006-51d7-478c2f1eef93
Marqueston Huff,"Fast, rangy, tough, loquacious defensive back who was miscast as a safety in his senior season, but projects best as a cornerback in the pros where his explosiveness and physicality will appeal to a wide range of teams. Should contribute readily on special teams and has eventual starter potential. Played his best football early in the season and tapered off late in the year.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marqueston-huff/32004855-4621-8767-88ab-bd2d465401a4
Ja'Wuan James,"Big, strong, heavy pass protector with good balance, anchor strength and hand use to handle power and speed. Does not affect the run game the same way and almost appears more destined for the left side in the pros. Has instant-starter potential.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ja-wuan-james/32004a41-4d21-8029-cd5c-4a092b767472
DaQuan Jones,"Big, strong-bodied interior force who shed weight and improved his stamina as a senior, displaying NFL-caliber physicality in the trenches. Has been inconsistent in the past, but if the light has come on, Jones' combination of size, power and movement enables him to play as a 4-3 one-technique or 3-4 five-technique.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daquan-jones/32004a4f-4e20-0565-dbce-63cc86919383
Cyrus Kouandjio,"Massive, long-limbed, inconsistent, overhyped college left tackle whose sheer dimensions, raw tools and high ceiling are far more appealing than his snap-to-snap performance at this stage of his development. Has enough length and anchor strength to survive on the left side, though he will never be a dancing bear, and he projects more ideally as a bulldozing right tackle in a power scheme.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cyrus-kouandjio/32004b4f-5505-9326-dbee-d24f37f74e65
Tre Mason,"The SEC Player of the Year, Mason is a compactly built, nifty-footed runner with a balanced skill set to merit 20 touches per game at the next level. Fits in multiple schemes and has the chops to make an impact as a rookie.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-mason/32004d41-5326-9896-60c2-fcddef859aa4
AJ McCarron,"An efficient game-managing quarterback who has shown he can carry an offense at times throughout his career, but more often is dependent on a terrific supporting cast. Grades out most highly for his intangibles and decision-making, knowing when and where to go with the ball, and could earn an NFL starting job.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aj-mccarron/32004d43-4317-6481-14f6-641e3cdc7a9a
Dan McCullers,"A big-bodied, short-area plugger with some underachiever traits, McCullers has raw tools that could become special if he learns to harness the innate strength in his body and pairs with a DL coach who can refine his mechanics.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dan-mccullers/32004d43-4373-2916-fca8-0330e1253e34
Trent Murphy,"As a base end in an even front or a LOLB in an odd front, Murphy's instincts, motor and toughness are what define his success and could allow him to eventually become a double-digit sack producer in the pros. Will require a few years to adapt to the speed of the NFL game.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trent-murphy/32004d55-5252-4597-e8ee-aa4d84c7fcc6
Troy Niklas,"A converted DE/OLB who emerged from the shadow of Bengals 2013 first-rounder Tyler Eifert, Niklas is the latest in a line of NFL tight ends produced by Notre Dame. He boasts an intriguing combination of size, athleticism, receiving ability and blocking ability to develop into a bona fide, balanced, No. 1 tight end. Has played tight end for just two years and arrow is pointing up.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/troy-niklas/32004e49-4b37-2127-f3d7-a2044f8a6e05
Rashaad Reynolds,"Good functional football player who capped his college career with a game-changing MVP performance in the Hawaii Bowl, where he returned two fumble recoveries for touchdowns. Has starter-quality physical traits and the positional skill to contribute readily in the pros. An underrated clingy cover man with a natural feel for the game.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashaad-reynolds/32005245-5959-4534-d16c-78cedbe060c6
Allen Robinson,"The Big Ten's leading receiver the last two seasons, Robinson is a big, fluid, outside receiver with a nice combination of ""above-the-rim"" prowess and run-after-catch ability. Offers possession skills, playmaking ability and red-zone utility to develop into a solid No. 2 option.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/allen-robinson/3200524f-4236-5982-45ce-8ca18ca03af8
Ed Stinson,"Long-framed, long-armed, prototype five-technique capable of kicking inside and manning the nose. Very impressive strength and power. Can play anywhere along a ""30"" front. An underrated cog in a defense, Stinson could play a long time in the league and may never receive his due outside the building.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ed-stinson/32005354-4963-8331-4230-6b05ad582a12
Xavier Su'a-Filo,"Does not look the part and was miscast when forced to play left tackle for the Bruins, but Su‚Äôa-Filo is more effective than he is pretty. Projects best at left guard, where he has starter-caliber ability in a power scheme, though he is athletic enough to appeal to zone teams, too.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xavier-su-a-filo/32005355-4120-7644-28c1-ef0d19aed7e8
Jason Verrett,"A tough, scrappy, undersized nickel back with potential to emerge as a No. 2 corner, Verrett's body is not ideally built to withstand the rigors of a starting job. An outstanding football player in the mold of feisty Titans 2006 seventh-round pick Cortland Finnegan.",6.2,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jason-verrett/32005645-5262-5072-52a7-9f712727c35f
Jeremiah Attaochu,"Georgia Tech‚Äôs all-time sack leader, Attaochu is a Nigerian-born, young, heady, disruptive, relentless edge rusher who profiles as 3-4 right outside linebacker. Should interview well, and has the look of a trustworthy, long-term starter given his pass-rush ability, motor and makeup.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremiah-attaochu/32004154-5429-0361-f785-1f0faf0b58b4
Joel Bitonio,"An undersized college left tackle who projects best to the inside in the pros. Displays the tenacity, leg drive and mean streak that is highly coveted by OL coaches and could drive up his draft status. Could require some initial patience moving inside, yet possesses the skill set, intelligence and desire to successfully convert.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joel-bitonio/32004249-5431-6411-4772-9ef0395824e9

Bashaud Breeland,"Very lean, rangy, athletic cover man who shows up well in run support and has good length to match up with big receivers. Will require technique refinement, but has an aggressive playing temperament that will appeal to coaches and moldable tools to develop.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bashaud-breeland/32004252-4518-3598-5e93-309c496e888d
Ego Ferguson,"Athletic, raw, developmental three-technique with clear upside, though he is inexperienced, aimless and unrefined at this stage of his development. Needs more glass in his diet and simply does not impact games the way he should. Is likely to test well and be drafted higher than his performance dictates in the hopes a defensive line coach can tap into his potential.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ego-ferguson/32004645-5208-8440-8d4d-af3dd9dd20a7
C.J. Fiedorowicz,"Big-framed, linear and dependable, Fiedorowicz looks the part and has balanced skills to be a legitimate ‚ÄúY‚Äù tight end in the pros. Is an asset as a competitive blocker and as a sure-handed receiver.

Earned the top assignment in a very talented backfield and has a similar build, running style and all-around utility as San Francisco 49ers 2005 third-round pick Frank Gore. Could prove to be a better pro than college player.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devonta-freeman/32004652-4517-4508-d090-1405fbc174e5
Seantrel Henderson,"Massive, strong-bodied, long-armed specimen with the physical gifts to be a dominant NFL right tackle in a power or slide-protection blocking scheme. However, he failed to live up to expectations in Coral Cables thanks to a tumultuous career marred by tragedy, suspensions, injuries and benchings. High-risk, high-reward, high-maintenance wild card who must convince decision-makers he‚Äôs worth gambling on. Interview process will go a long way in determining his trustworthiness.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/seantrel-henderson/32004845-4e13-5162-f37d-41eb0993d9a5
Timmy Jernigan,"Slightly undersized, stoutly built, country-strong run stopper with the ability to drop anchor inside an odd front and develop into a solid, 3-4 movement nose tackle. Strength is his calling card despite his relatively modest size.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/timmy-jernigan/32004a45-5246-5471-bd34-7727794e868a
Anthony Johnson,"Big, athletic, overhyped defensive tackle who shows in flashes, but leaves evaluators wanting more and would have benefited from a more dominant junior season. Fits best in an even front, though he‚Äôs not instant coffee, as his tweener skill set is too unrefined to project absolutely as a nose or three-technique. Will test well but draw varied opinions, and has the look of a boom-or-bust prospect.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-johnson/32004a4f-4805-7828-1683-d3a7dc47a05c
Jarvis Landry,"Polished, quarterback-friendly, sure-handed possession receiver with a flare for the highlight-reel catch. Could be an effective No. 3 option, capable of lining up as a ""Z"" or slot, working short-to-intermediate and beating zone coverage.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jarvis-landry/32004c41-4e16-3029-78da-4985470f8aab
Craig Loston,"A big, hard-hitting, vocal secondary leader who showed better as a junior lining up along a more talented secondary next to Eric Reid than he did as a senior. However, still possesses starter-caliber traits as an interchangeable safety most ideally suited playing in the box.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/craig-loston/32004c4f-5370-9456-b046-60f476b44b6d
Marcus Martin,"Outstanding-sized, barrel-chested finesse pivot with center-guard versatility. Grades out highly as a position-sustain blocker and possesses untappped strength and power in his body. Lacks desirable grit, toughness and finishing strength to maximize his talent and is stronger than he plays. Has instant-starter potential as a center or right guard, but could stand to benefit from some time to be groomed.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-martin/32004d41-5267-5292-9a58-9b57306ad5eb
Jordan Matthews,"A relative of Jerry Rice, Matthews departs Vanderbilt as the most productive pass catcher in SEC history. He‚Äôs a tall, narrow-framed, West Coast possession receiver with soft hands, a professional approach and the versatility to line up inside or outside and become a solid No. 2 or No. 3. High-floor prospect whose timed speed could dictate his ultimate draft value.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-matthews/32004d41-5456-9663-2598-657f4f0af257
Jack Mewhort,"Thickly built, physical, highly competitive lineman who manned left tackle competently in college, but is better suited for the right side in the pros. Has starter-caliber strength, athleticism and technique supplemented with desirable intangibles. Versatility to play guard or left tackle in a pinch adds to value.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jack-mewhort/32004d45-5726-6972-353e-d91e0b86a793
Austin Seferian-Jenkins,"An intriguing height-weight-speed prospect, Seferian-Jenkins has all the tools to be a legitimate No. 1 tight end in the NFL, though he has to maintain focus and consistency and continue improving as a blocker.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-seferian-jenkins/32005345-4617-7981-4435-ee8f0a8353f1
Will Sutton,"Bulked up and added a lot of bad weight as a senior, negating his initial burst and diminishing his production, yet still showed good quickness off the ball. Played at a more natural weight and was noticeably a step quicker in 2012. Fits best as an under tackle in an even front and would be best playing close to 290 pounds.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-sutton/32005355-5476-8626-d59b-c17813288121

John Urschel,"Underpowered, quick-footed, scrappy,  zone blocker with the smarts, movement skill and competitive zeal to emerge as a very efficient pro. Displays the quickness highly desired at the pivot and might prove to be best at center.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-urschel/32005552-5311-1903-c8c2-027523bf59a0
Kyle Van Noy,"Good-sized, athletic, smooth-moving stand-up player who projects best as a 3-4 right outside linebacker, but could also warrant consideration from 4-3 teams as a Will or Sam. Is not without flaws, but has unique ability to play up the field, laterally or in reverse.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-van-noy/32005641-4e65-6604-35eb-7909415e4155
Andre Williams,"Very strong, stocky, powerful runner with the instincts, contact balance and toughness to carry a heavy workload. Really emerged as a senior, when he led the nation in rushing, and proved worthy of a starting role.",6.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-williams/32005749-4c14-2264-4861-9de23cdd2565
Jace Amaro,"Highly productive, finesse, detached tight end who racked up 106 receptions for 1,352 yards (12.8) and seven TDs as a junior when he was essentially an inside receiver for the Red Raiders. Will have to play a similar role in the pros, as he is not equipped to survive in-line.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jace-amaro/3200414d-4156-3609-a039-2bbcc5050de2
Dri Archer,Explosive playmaker lacking requisite size for the pro game. Was slowed by an ankle injury early and did not return to junior form until late in senior season. Can make an immediate impact in the return game and add value as a multipurpose threat. Long-term durability is greatest concern given tiny frame.,5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dri-archer/32004152-4342-5790-eb07-e3abf1efc087
Lamin Barrow,"Undersized, athletic, run-around see-and-go reactor who needs to be protected to be effective. Projects as a Will linebacker, nickel defender and special-teams contributor.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lamin-barrow/32004241-5266-2715-2f88-0b885b23c9ef
Tajh Boyd,"Difficult to prepare for and difficult to block, Boyd is a short, athletic, strong-armed quarterback with Wildcat value and starter potential in a vertical-power system, though he is the type you look to replace. The success of Russell Wilson likely helps Boyd‚Äôs cause, but he is not as polished and might be better suited as a backup.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tajh-boyd/3200424f-5934-1422-c65d-b76b0aa076e4

Deandre Coleman,"A very big, strong, two-gapping plugger ideally suited to stack the corner of an odd front. Will make a living digging his feet in the dirt and defending the run.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deandre-coleman/3200434f-4c24-0969-4fda-694c1b2c075b
Brandon Coleman,"Big, tall, talented, West Coast receiver whose sheer size enables him to be effective outside the numbers, on slant routes and in the red zone, though inconsistency has prevented him from reaching his potential. Has the look of a No. 2 receiver, but his production fell off as a junior (played through a knee injury). He could have used another season to polish his skills.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-coleman/3200434f-4c22-2062-6e9b-1b84ac3daffd
Scott Crichton,"Strong, athletic, raw defensive end prospect who would have been better served returning for his senior season. Despite being rough around the edges at this stage of his development, Crichton shows in flashes and has power potential as a 4-3 defensive end. Could require patience.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/scott-crichton/32004352-4912-5056-8c54-a2aae8b02afd
Aaron Donald,"Short, scrappy, instinctive, highly productive defensive lineman who does not look the part, but inspires confidence he can be an exception to the rule.

Dakota Dozier,"Small-school college left tackle best suited to kick inside in the pros. Has the girth and enough athletic ability to compete as a guard or center and ornery football disposition desired in the trenches. A tough, gritty, road grader capable of paving the way in the run game, Dozier will require some technique refinement in pass protection, yet possesses clear starter potential with continued development. Draft status could ascend if he proves he can play center.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dakota-dozier/3200444f-5a29-0704-fb3a-3dc3b8ced775
Laurent Duvernay-Tardif,"Tough, gritty, smart battler who transformed from an impactful 250-pound three-technique as a freshman. Made a successful conversion to left tackle as a sophomore and has grown to be a dominating Canadian 315-pound left tackle expected to be the first pick of the CFL draft. Projects best inside in the pros and could prove to be the best product delivered from Canada's developmental system since Israel Idonije. Will require refinement, but has the physical tools and temperament that cannot be taught.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/laurent-duvernay-tardif/32004455-5648-9970-114a-4ef52ebc6afe
Bruce Ellington,"A two-sport athlete who has already graduated, Ellington opted to forgo basketball and his senior football season to enter the draft. While he lacks desirable height and might not be an elite tester, Ellington brings explosiveness, hands and playmaking ability to the slot. Arrow is pointing up, and his desirable intangibles inspire confidence he'll reach his potential, especially now that he's able to focus solely on football.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bruce-ellington/3200454c-4c16-4961-7f3d-56bdfb64d33c
Antone Exum,"A big, strong cornerback who must prove that he can recover from offseason knee surgery and return to being the player he was as a junior, when he graded out highly in press coverage, as a tackler and for his ability to make plays on the ball. Has a unique combination of size and speed.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antone-exum/32004558-5541-5291-4ef3-95700d6f6049
Dee Ford,"High-motor college left defensive end better suited for a rush linebacker role in the pros.

Jimmy Garoppolo,"A decorated, FCS passer, Garoppolo could excite quarterback coaches with his quick delivery, mental make-up and work habits, yet he still needs to prove he can fit the ball into tight windows and do more than carve up soft shells the way he regularly did on his way to a record-breaking performance in college. Possesses the physical tools to eventually earn an NFL starting job in a rhythm passing game with continued refinement, but is more of a caretaker than a game changer and will require some patience adapting to the NFL game.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jimmy-garoppolo/32004741-5236-3225-90e6-5bfdba41064c
Adrian Hubbard,"A long-bodied, athletic rush linebacker with the base strength desired in a 4-3 left defensive end, Hubbard's greatest physical trait is his core functional strength and ability to leverage the edge and defend the run. Is still developing as a pass rusher and offers the scheme versatility and upside to interest any defense. Has starter traits, but has yet to reach the impact level he thinks he makes. Has upside if the light bulb comes on.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/adrian-hubbard/32004855-4216-3574-f6ea-a30ef66ac3a8
James Hurst,"A wide-bodied, overachieving, college left tackle more ideally suited for the right side in the pros. Is football smart, gritty and competitive enough to eventually enter a starting lineup, but would be an ideal backup swing tackle on a strong offensive line and might even benefit from kicking inside where he'd have help on each side.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-hurst/32004855-5249-6348-c3a7-2a2a441b214e
T.J. Jones,"Athletic, smooth-moving, polished receiver who runs crisp routes, has terrific hands and boasts NFL bloodlines. Balanced skill set, dependability and versatility will be valued at the next level, where he could be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 receiver in a sophisticated passing system. Arrow pointing up.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-jones/32004a4f-4e73-1255-22f2-c41bfb1a40f3
Cassius Marsh,"Very active, high-motor, steady, consistent producer. Lacks ideal bulk for the inside and speed to work the edges, but can set the edge and bring value to an odd front in a LOLB role or as a Sam linebacker. Is most natural moving forward piercing gaps. Will need to be managed, needs to cut down on errors and must learn to play within the structure of the defense.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cassius-marsh/32004d41-5233-6314-c691-7d19dd9a933e
Keith McGill,"Big, athletic, press-man corner who can excite scouts when they get an up-close look at his movement skills. However, he has a junior-college background, does not play to his size and will need to be managed closely to maximize his talent. Appears destined for Pete Carroll's defense.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keith-mcgill/32004d43-4739-5307-cf49-569f64f0a246
Ronald Powell,"Powell is a physically gifted, inconsistent, college ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù (hybrid defensive end/outside linebacker) with crude strength and athleticism. Has developmental value as a stand-up rush linebacker, but must dedicate himself to the craft and realize he‚Äôs no longer the big man on campus.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronald-powell/3200504f-5747-9487-b9ca-0389fa4e130f
Kelcy Quarles,"Thickly built, long-armed, talented defensive tackle who was not as consistently dominant as his numbers or accolades suggest.

Trevor Reilly,"A country-strong, throwback, wrangler cowboy with the toughness desired to set the edge and the motor, intensity and competitiveness to produce effort sacks. Can factor as a 3-4 rush linebacker in an odd front or match up with tight ends as a strong-side linebacker in an even front. Could contribute readily as a situational rusher and, with continued strength gains, emerge as a DE prospect. Versatility is a plus.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevor-reilly/32005245-4957-5845-3b5c-a10a07f6bdb0
Cyril Richardson,"Massive road grader with grown-man strength which enables him to reestablish the line of scrimmage in the run game and thwart the rush. Versatility to play right tackle adds to value and he has plug-and-play capability in a power scheme, though bust factor cannot be ignored.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cyril-richardson/32005249-4339-7677-8e60-cbc2a02dd3eb
Marcus Roberson,"Lean, athletic, finesse cornerback who did not elevate his game in 2013 when injuries, suspension and inconsistency marred his junior season. Is best deployed in off-man or zone and could develop into a No. 2 or No. 3 corner if he regains his sophomore form, though he lacks desirable instincts and tackling ability.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-roberson/3200524f-4208-3134-9c4e-1aac87a7625d
Charles Sims,"Athletic, competitive, tough, upright slasher who is an asset as a receiver -- hands rate among the best on a RB in recent years. Cannot project as a bellcow, but offers playmaking ability as part of a tandem in a zone scheme. Speed and durability could determine ultimate draft value.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charles-sims/32005349-4d66-9037-7ba3-68002102644f
Yawin Smallwood,"Productive college middle linebacker at his best when he‚Äôs kept clean or has a clear path. Projects best in a 4-3, where he has enough athleticism and functionality in coverage to play in the middle or on the weak side. Has starter-caliber potential, but might be the type you look to replace.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/yawin-smallwood/3200534d-4175-9621-159c-6245e599bb27
Marcus Smith,"A high school quarterback turned pass rusher who broke out with 14.5 sacks as a senior (1.12 sacks-per-game average led nation), Smith projects as a pass-rushing, 3-4 right outside linebacker in the pros. Should contribute initially on passing downs and has eventual starter potential as his game becomes more well-rounded.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-smith/3200534d-4900-0009-e490-92b408873601
Shamar Stephen,"Big, athletic, raw interior defender with underachiever traits who had a fairly nondescript career at UConn, but has crude physical tools for a defensive line coach to mold. Developmental prospect who potentially fits in a 4-3 or as a 3-4 five-technique.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shamar-stephen/32005354-4535-1003-a782-1b134d8c1c30
Brandon Thomas,"Strong-bodied, dependable gap blocker who played left tackle in college but will likely slide inside in the pros. Showed improvement as a senior and has the potential to be a long-term fixture at left guard. Ability to play tackle in a pinch adds to value.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-thomas/32005448-4f04-3949-68b1-bb9eda924eb1
De'Anthony Thomas,"A deluxe, specialty back and potential slot receiver with game-breaking return ability, Thomas can be an explosive mismatch weapon in multiple facets of the game.  Diminutive stature will decrease the odds he'll be able to stay healthy in the pros, and his commitment to the game will dictate his future success. Rare speed creates a higher commodity on Draft Day.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/de-anthony-thomas/32005448-4f09-5665-2ec7-1e2e24294c99
Logan Thomas,"Unrefined, strong-armed, sturdy pocket passer who looks the part and has intriguing, raw arm talent, though he is a converted tight end whose inexperience showed throughout a yo-yo career in Blacksburg. Has definite developmental value given his starter-caliber skill set and intangible makeup. Would benefit from coaching continuity, more specifically a QB coach capable of refining his crude talent.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/logan-thomas/32005448-4f29-6280-e212-928e7f08f1ce
Brock Vereen,"A very smart, pedigreed, rangy free safety with the athletic ability and cover skill desired on the back end. Lack of size and tackling strength could leave much to be desired when defending the run. Top-notch intangibles -- toughness, instincts, competitiveness and leadership ability -- should allow him to quickly emerge as a defensive leader and enhance his draft status.",5.9,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brock-vereen/32005645-5227-1236-e578-b4480f704a67

Terrance West,"Good-sized, compactly built, highly productive, physical workhorse and program-changer who took Towson to new heights while dominating inferior competition.

Jared Abbrederis,"A former walk-on, Abbrederis went from afterthought to scholarship player to No. 1 receiver. While the blue-collar overachiever lacks exceptional athletic traits for the NFL, he's a steady ""X"" receiver whose hands and smarts could enable him to work his way into a No. 3 or No. 4 receiver role.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jared-abbrederis/32004142-4265-0964-fc36-bb0ad76ff6e6

Bene' Benwikere,"Smooth, productive nickel corner more proficent vs. the pass than run. Benwikere's game lacks physicality, yet his zone cover skills could allow him to carve a role in the slot and on special teams. Needs to be challenged to maximize his potential and would benefit from a demanding positional coach.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bene-benwikere/32004245-4e78-0726-e659-bc89a69bcd34

Alfred Blue,"Blue looks the part and would have been the No. 1 back at most schools given his combination of size, speed, power and competitiveness. Is a second-round talent on physical ability alone, but injury and a stacked stable of LSU runners limited Blue‚Äôs opportunity to shine. Scheme-versatile runner who is a prime candidate to elevate his stock prior to the draft and be a far more productive pro than college player.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alfred-blue/3200424c-5510-6654-1ff2-5c94a5fcf6a2

Chris Boyd,"Big, slender, West Coast, short-to-intermediate possession receiver who could compete for a job as a No. 4 or No. 5. Having sat the year out, Boyd‚Äôs performance at the combine and in workouts will determine draft standing.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-boyd/3200424f-5906-8876-4b85-ddcc64250c43
Carl Bradford,"An undersized college defensive end, Bradford projects to outside linebacker in a 3-4 front in the pros, where his physical dimensions and rush ability are best suited. Would profile best in an aggressive, one-gapping odd front such as the Colts, Jets, Ravens or Steelers.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carl-bradford/32004252-4109-6195-27a5-cc20feaa51d5
Jay Bromley,"Well-built, inconsistent interior defender with enough strength, athleticism and pass-rush ability to contribute in a rotational role. Best fits as a 4-3 defensive tackle, but could appeal to teams running a hybrid scheme given his potential to be used as a five-technique.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jay-bromley/32004252-4f10-6058-ab29-f0a077e34b28
Terrence Brooks,"Lean, athletic, long-limbed hybrid safety with an appealing combination of fluidity, range and physicality. Versatile defender who can be deployed over the top as a ‚Äúrobber‚Äù or in the box. Has starter-caliber ability if he if he‚Äôs able to shore up his tackling and become a more productive on-the-ball defender, but at worst should be a solid backup and core special-teams player.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terrence-brooks/32004252-4f17-2431-b6c3-4555505c8682
Jonathan Brown,"Undersized, athletic, finesse, inconsistent Will linebacker who needs to be kept clean to be effective. Small frame, deficient instincts and soft run defense likely relegate him to a backup role, and he will have to excel on special teams.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-brown/32004252-4f49-9880-e01e-8b1c679b759d
Martavis Bryant,"A lean, long-limbed, rangy, outside-the-numbers, big-play receiver, Bryant declared for the draft early with underclassmen nipping at his playing time late in the season. Will require additional seasoning to make a mark in the pro game. A better tester than football player at this stage of his development.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/martavis-bryant/32004252-5949-9889-454c-e391134402be
Deone Bucannon,"Although he's built like a cornerback, Bucannon's style of play makes it easy to identify him as a tone-setting strong safety. Has coverage limitations, but brings the aggressiveness and physicality to carve a niche as a downhill box defender and core special-teams player.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deone-bucannon/32004255-4301-9775-ddd0-ee757e3909cf
Max Bullough,"Big, tough, experienced, durable, competitive Mike linebacker who was a heart-and-soul type for the stingiest defense in college football. Like a coach on the field, Bullough is a throwback talent whose instincts and technique will have to compensate for athletic limitations for him to win a starting role.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/max-bullough/32004255-4c61-3806-fc07-d5a2d631abeb

Trey Burton,"A savvy, athletic, undersized H-back who was utilized in a flexed receiving role in the Gators' offense. Has the athletic traits to earn a living working detached out of the slot as an 'F' tight end. Can offer a creative offensive coordinator a versatile jack-of-all-trades gimmick weapon.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-burton/32004255-5281-7654-2730-ce3d8995f838
Kain Colter,"An athletic, undersized, multi-threat, option college quarterback who shared time in the slot, Colter displayed the playmaking ability, short-area burst, creativity and hands to become a Danny Amendola-type slot receiver and should be able to factor readily in the pros once he commits full-time to the position. Offers situational Wildcat quarterbacking capability and return ability with traits that project very well as a punt returner. Postseason ankle surgery will limit his spring workouts and could dip his draft standing.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kain-colter/3200434f-4c78-4431-ed16-f666193d9fae
Aaron Colvin,"Long, smart, tough, zone corner whose body is not built to withstand heavy contact or the aggression with which he likes to play. Will grow on evaluators the more they watch him and has the instincts to eventually compete for a starting job, though teams could always be looking to upgrade his lack of speed and athletic ability. Torn ACL injury suffered at the Senior Bowl will affect his readiness for the season and could drop his draft status by a round or two.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aaron-colvin/3200434f-4c80-1093-56e2-0a6eea08a9c0
Chris Davis,"A compact, physical zone corner with intriguing return skill, Davis will be more challenged by his lack of height and tight hips in the pros. His intangibles, toughness against the run and ability to factor as a punt returner will allow him to carve out a role.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-davis/32004441-5623-3017-61c9-d0454743a2e0
Mike Davis,"A big, long, athletic receiver with inconsistent hands and questionable toughness and effort. Displays starter-caliber physical traits, yet his playing demeanor and approach turn off many evaluators and could force his draft status to sink. Is at his best outside the numbers as an ""X"" receiver.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-davis/32004441-5656-7425-fa74-a29a674d4a6e

Ahmad Dixon,"Box safety possessing the physical talent to compete in the NFL and even earn a starting job eventually if he can stay focused, commit to a playbook and hone his eyes. Should be able to factor readily on special teams. Coverage limitations will leave him vulnerable and would be best in a very simple scheme.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ahmad-dixon/32004449-5804-2141-a346-20988d9aeedb
Jonathan Dowling,"Lean, long-levered, smooth-muscled, finesse free safety with speed and range, though he‚Äôs more interested in hitting than securing tackles -- he does not provide dependability desired on the back end.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-dowling/3200444f-5754-8703-794e-592a3cc092fc
Greg Ducre,"Stood out in the College All-Star Bowl, when he earned MVP honors scoring the game's only touchdown on a 30-yard interception return and followed it up with an exceptional pro day performance that create the opportunity to compete for a job in sub-packages immediately in the pros. A late-riser with physical tools that could allow him to be a better pro than college player.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/greg-ducre/32004455-4375-3589-2932-4331a8b4a210
Dominique Easley,"Undersized, explosive, athletic, high-motor three-technique whose junior season was cut short in Week 3 by a knee injury. Injury history will likely affect his draft stock, but when healthy, he shows the ability to disrupt the backfield and pressure the quarterback. Fits best in an aggressive scheme in which he could use his quickness to slant, stunt and shoot gaps.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dominique-easley/32004541-5307-1808-9777-a5702233aa10

Cameron Fleming,"Big, thickly built, experienced right tackle who graduated with a degree in aeronautics and astronautics and entered the draft early despite standing to benefit from another year of seasoning on The Farm. Has size and smarts to stick in a power/slide-protection scheme, but needs to make strides with his functional strength, technique and aggressiveness. Could be tried inside.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-fleming/3200464c-4515-7731-f0ee-1683da2b3966
Khairi Fortt,"A better athlete than football player at this stage of his development, Fortt transferred from Penn State and played only one season at Cal before making a premature jump to the NFL. Speedy, finesse, see-and-go reactor who looks the part and has intriguing, starter-caliber athleticism to fit on the weak side in a fast-flowing 4-3 where he‚Äôs freed up to chase the ball. Should be a combine all-star and is draftable on measurables alone, but must sharpen his eyes and instincts to reach his potential.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/khairi-fortt/3200464f-5272-8327-24d0-b1d369bf9dcb
Zach Fulton,"Physically impressive, moldable right guard prospect with a good soldier's attitude to go along with untapped physical ability, though his tape falls short of his intangibles at this stage of his development. Could be a pet project for an offensive line coach confident he can turn Fulton into an effective mauler.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-fulton/32004655-4c77-0022-484d-dc8e23cdbe85
E.J. Gaines,"Strong, physical zone corner with the toughness, awareness and football IQ to function highly in short spaces. A solid tackler, Gaines plays bigger than his size and takes a professional approach. Can make an immediate impact on special teams and work his way into a lineup.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/e-j-gaines/32004741-4929-2759-c0f4-d48eed113920
James Gayle,"Explosive, high-motor see-and-go reactor whose calling card is his ability to pressure the edge. Does not play to his weight-room numbers against the run and lacks desirable length and smarts, projecting as a situational 3-4 rush linebacker.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-gayle/32004741-5964-0464-3df2-1c06c43f15c1
Ryan Groy,"Big, durable, blue-collar guard who is generally effective despite lacking exceptional physical traits. As a starter, is the type you look to replace, but could be serviceable backup in a slide-protection scheme given his size, intelligence and functional anchor.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-groy/32004752-4f78-3374-782b-a58616e67f2c

Victor Hampton,"A big, thick-bodied, physical cover man who looks more destined for a future at safety than cornerback in the pros. Size and physicality will appeal to teams, though character concerns will cloud his draft status and could knock him off some draft boards. Will require close monitoring and has bust potential.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/victor-hampton/32004841-4d78-4439-bb10-06ead64419cc
Jonotthan Harrison,"Very good-sized mauler functions well in a phone booth. Possesses the strength and power to match up vs. big bodies. The farther he is asked to move, the more he will struggle and would be best in a man-blocking power scheme.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonotthan-harrison/32004841-5260-1814-a858-5588cbbb9d50
Taylor Hart,"Big-framed, smart, active, high-effort player who willingly does the dirty work and will make it difficult for coaches to cut him. Best chance to stick could be as a five-technique, but could also draw interest as a developmental left end. Has the makeup to surprise if he learns to play with power.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taylor-hart/32004841-5270-4616-e460-08a723c39a05
Robert Herron,"Very diminutive, outside receiver with the timed speed to threaten the field vertically and potentially contribute in the return game. Needs to prove he can bow up against better competition and is more than a track athlete.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-herron/32004845-5272-2941-e8ee-1057ffed4cbc
Josh Huff,"Smooth, competitive, versatile receiver with an impressive skill set which translates well to the evolution of NFL offenses. Can work at flanker or slot and has potential to become a No. 2 or No. 3 receiver in a system incorporating spread concepts. Is the type of player you root for, having persevered through an adverse upbringing and lingering baggage, which forced him to mature the hard way. Would be best served landing in a close-knit locker room with a nurturing position coach.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-huff/32004855-4619-4666-462e-733a8d72faa0
Gabe Ikard,"A functional positional blocker who lacks the foot quickness, athletic ability and strength desired in a starter, yet consistently finds a way to get the job done and overcome his physical limitations. Intelligence and intangibles are off the charts and could allow him to capture and hold onto a starting job. The sum is better than the parts.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gabe-ikard/3200494b-4156-3610-6af9-07e1a00345db
Bennett Jackson,"Looks the part, but strength, technical and instinctual deficiences are too significant to overlook. Did not distinguish himself enough as a senior to be considered more than a developmental prospect.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bennett-jackson/32004a41-4300-0002-407b-1bf1dfb9f1a6
Andrew Jackson,"Sawed-off, stout, physical, downhill thumper with eventual-starter potential inside a 3-4 front where he's protected and able to attack the ball. However, suspect character and work ethic make him a risky investment, and he'd be best served in a locker room with a strong veteran presence.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-jackson/32004a41-4303-5265-ab6a-b140cc892b70
Kendall James,"Undersized, fluid, quick-twitch, college field corner who figures to raise eyebrows when the stopwatches come out before the draft.

Stanley Jean-Baptiste,"A receiver-turned-cornerback in a safety‚Äôs body, Jean-Baptiste looks the part and has intriguing ball skills, strength and upside, though he lacks elite athletic ability, is smoother than he is sudden and does not consistently play to his size. Workout numbers will dictate his ultimate role and draft value, but on tape shows skills to warrant developmental consideration from teams employing press or Cover 2.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stanley-jean-baptiste/32004a45-4141-3603-4425-84d8b95bd149
Marcel Jensen,"Strapping, athletic, long-armed, ascending talent who did not play a starring role in a run-and-gun, receiver-dominated spread offense, but has raw physical tools to develop into a balanced ‚ÄúY‚Äù tight end. Should only get better and has potential to become an asset in the running game and a mismatch in the passing game.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcel-jensen/32004a45-4e74-0137-1b77-256435a8bc82
Derrell Johnson,"A strong, stocky, compactly built, leverage-power rusher who operates mostly out of a crouched, 2-point stance and brings a bulldog tenacity to the field.

Storm Johnson,"A Miami transfer, Johnson is a big, nifty-footed runner with enough run strength and burst to be productive in a downhill power scheme or as a one-cut zone runner. However, he will have to take better care of the football and make strides in pass protection to earn carries.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/storm-johnson/32004a4f-4867-6033-7416-4042182072ec
Wesley Johnson,"Experienced, intelligent, competitive, athletic, strength-deficient zone blocker.

Christian Jones,"Chiseled, height-weight-speed see-and-go reactor with intriguing athleticism, versatility and upside who shows in flashes, but leaves evaluators wanting more. Is likely to boost his stock during the pre-draft process, and could warrant consideration from 4-3 teams as a Sam or Will, or from 3-4 teams as a rush linebacker. Play will reach another level if/when his processor speed catches up to his physical talent.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-jones/32004a4f-4e16-2414-35d1-5135a3ceaefd
Howard Jones,"Lean, explosive, highly athletic rush linebacker prospect who overwhelmed inferior tackles at the Division II level and has clear developmental value and upside potential. Best deployed with pinned ears and see-ball, get-ball instructions, Jones is raw, but has enticing speed and crude pass-rush ability for a patient, positional coach to mold.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/howard-jones/32004a4f-4e40-2377-4693-619d6c94149d
Lamarcus Joyner,"A good college football player lacking ideal physical traits for the NFL game. Functioned well as a short-hole, nickel zone corner for a national championship team and was well-schemed to play the ball in front of him and turned loose to attack. Classic 'tweener who could compete in situational packages, but is vulnerable to be mismatched against. Will need to make his mark on special teams and in the return game to carve a role. Has a make-it attitude and winning mentality that could allow him to overcome his physical limitations. Compares favorably to Panthers 2009 seventh-rounder Captain Munnerlyn.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lamarcus-joyner/32004a4f-5946-4866-7495-d5ac553be826

Tyler Larsen,"Big, experienced, wall-off zone blocker with a ceiling as a serviceble starter, though questionable versatility detracts from his appeal in a league offering few center-only spots.

Cody Latimer,"A prep basketball standout, Latimer is a well-built, sure-handed, West Coast possession receiver whose hardwood background is evident in his leaping ability, body control and hand-eye coordination. Lacks ideal explosiveness, gear change and flexibility. Could be effective running slants and making contested catches to beat zone coverage and succeed in the red zone. Has a ceiling as a No. 3.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-latimer/32004c41-5436-2049-958f-bfa0ead37c46
Charles Leno Jr.,"Long-armed, soft-bodied college left tackle most ideally suited for a role as a versatile, swing backup in a zone-blocking scheme. Has not learned how to translate his athletic ability and explosion to the field, yet possesses enough length, agility and untapped talent to find a role for a patient offensive line coach. Could warrant interest inside as a guard or center where he has help on each side.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charles-leno-jr/32004c45-4e38-9697-72fb-56c35895c239
Brandon Linder,"Big, experienced, highly competitive, short-area base blocker at his best in a phone booth. Lacks ideal power and athleticism, but has football intelligence, leadership traits and a bulldog‚Äôs mentality.

Colt Lyerla,"A physically talented receiving tight end, Lyerla was overshadowed by the play of emerging freshman Johnny Mundt and litany of issues (suspensions, drugs, academics). Has overcome a lot of adversity stemming back to his youth and defied the odds to become an impactful performer. Talent grades could garner interest in the second round, but past history could easily knock him down several rounds and off many draft boards. Would benefit tremendously from a coach willing to serve as a strong father figure.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/colt-lyerla/32004c59-4556-3610-f71d-1c0a87750be2
Aaron Lynch,"A big, athletic prospect who displayed the most potential as a freshman at Notre Dame. Has underachieved since transferring closer to home and shedding considerable weight. Must prove motivated to reach his potential. Finished the season strong and finally showed signs of the talent he displayed as a standout freshman. Could benefit from a strong, mentoring, veteran position coach. Interview process will dictate draft status.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aaron-lynch/32004c59-4e06-2058-4e72-7a4dad2e318d

Jeff Mathews,"Very driven, Ivy-League pocket passer with physical limitations that could relegate him to a backup role in the pros. Is the type who can be trusted to step in with limited practice reps and finish a game. Might have the most long-term potential as a coach, yet has the intangible qualities that could allow him to stick in the league for 10-plus years. Has traits to surprise as a spot-starter once he acclimates to the pro game.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeff-mathews/32004d41-5456-5954-ff99-c80cee2c4422
Josh Mauro,"English-born, high-motor, developmental five-technique with intriguing growth potential. Is a bit top-heavy. Still growing into his body and learning how to use his hands. Has generated solid production from a wave role and could continue to be molded into a solid fencepost for a 3-4 front. Draws semblances to a young Brett Keisel, drafted in the seventh round by the Steelers in 2002, and has the makeup to play a long time in an unsung role occupying blockers and defending the run.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-mauro/32004d41-5564-0520-dec8-88f7b32eea0a
Jerick McKinnon,"Jack of all trades, master of none. Adjusted from a triple-option quarterbacking role as a junior to a tailback role as a senior and has enough athletic ability to warrant a chance as a change-of-pace back in the pros. Could even be tried as a return man and cornerback, where he began his college career. Would benefit from focusing on one position and will require some time to develop. Practice-squad candidate.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerick-mckinnon/32004d43-4b65-6764-e685-6b07f4dbac28
Zach Mettenberger,"Pure dropback, strong-armed thrower who will require patient, confidence-building play-calling and a clean pocket to function at a high level in the NFL. Has starter talent in a vertical, downfield passing attack if he can learn to take command of a huddle and continue progressing as a decision-maker. How he interviews with teams could go a long way toward determining his draft status.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-mettenberger/32004d45-5453-2718-5b45-bf5c214d724d
Terrance Mitchell,"Wiry, smoother-than-sudden, off-man/cover-3 corner who upped his visibility as a junior by showing improved playmaking ability, which prompted a premature leap to the NFL. Could compete for a job as a No. 4, but lack of ideal explosiveness, top-end speed and bump-and-run ability limits his ceiling.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terrance-mitchell/32004d49-5473-1784-ea28-1ba6d94f8c31
Zach Moore,"Raw, physically gifted, Division II standout with untapped potential given his combination of size, length and movement skills.

Stephen Morris,"Will tease evaluators with his arm and athletic talent, but has yet to prove he can throw with the precision needed to sustain a starting job in the pros. Has clear starting-caliber traits, but is still learning what it takes to direct an offense and make good decisions and is still very much a work in progress. Has talent worth molding in a backup role and will pique the interest of QB coaches who work him out in the spring and view his raw tools. Will require a strong offensive line and a full supporting cast of weapons to function in a starting role.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stephen-morris/32004d4f-5253-6881-1589-0c00b5d740bc

Aaron Murray,"Diminutive, game-managing pocket passer still recovering from a torn ACL. Would benefit from a moving pocket that can create open throwing lanes, yet does not have the foot quickness desired for a rollout passing game.

Solomon Patton,"Tiny, athletic playmaker with the toughness, burst and acceleration to factor readily in the return game and offer a flair as a receiver.

Paul Richardson,"Very lean, narrow-framed, finesse ""X"" receiver who made an immediate impact at Colorado before knee injuries derailed his progress. Measurables will go a long way in determining his ultimate draft value, and his success at the next level is dependent upon his ability to make plays in the vertical passing game.

Weston Richburg,"Adequate-sized, smart, experienced, competitive center who commanded the offensive line, made all the calls and was a team leader for the Rams.

Richard Rodgers,"Rodgers‚Äô career arc was affected by Cal‚Äôs coaching turnover, as the former high school receiver was recruited as a tight end by Jeff Tedord‚Äôs staff and bulked up to 275 pounds as a sophomore when he was out of shape, in part because of a torn labrum and torn foot ligament. As a junior, Rodgers shed 30 pounds and shifted to inside receiver for Sonny Dykes, enabling him to show his more natural ‚ÄúF‚Äù tight end skills. Is an unpolished product, but could be a better pro than college player.",5.8,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/richard-rodgers/3200524f-4455-2970-37e4-0434a3fd93f7
Michael Sam,"A productive, 4-3 weakside rusher who came on as a senior and it made his last season his best.

Jalen Saunders,"A Fresno State transfer, Saunders is a lightweight, quicker-than-fast, competitive slot receiver and punt returner.

Chris Smith,"A weakside pass rusher who could most ideally project to the rush linebacker position in the pros for a 3-4 front, Smith graded more highly as a junior than he did as a senior, yet possesses the tools to earn a starting job in the pros in multiple schemes.

Tyler Gaffney,"Gaffney, who doubles as a baseball player, rejoined the Cardinal football team after a one-year stint in Class A. Did not skip a beat, shouldering the load as a feature back and putting himself back on the NFL radar by showing inside running skills as a big, athletic, downhill back willing to grind out the tough yards.

Will require time to acclimate to the speed of the NFL game.",5.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dustin-vaughan/32005641-5509-3530-f0a0-7475ff5cf69a

Nikita Whitlock,"Short, stock, undersized college nose tackle with the urgency, hand violence and toughness desired at the fullback position in the pros. Lacks length for the interior defensive line, but might even be able to supply a spark in a situational role for a Tampa-2 front given his elite quickness and gap discipline. A Rod Marinelli-type player.",5.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nikita-whitlock/32005748-4968-3244-b3b7-09445ef0570e
Khalil Wilkes,"Try-hard, overachiever lacking ideal size, bulk strength and agility to handle NFL glass-eaters. Has enough grit and football intelligence to fend for a roster spot, but limited versatility will diminish his chances.",5.1,2014,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/khalil-wilkes/32005749-4c08-0371-308d-5d2409f5e799

Leonard Williams,"Enormously powerful defensive lineman. Has the look and feel of the biggest, strongest kid on the playground but hasn't figured out how to unlock his natural gifts and consistently dominate the rest of the kids on the playground just yet. Williams can play in an odd or even front, and is able to hold the point as a two-gapper or disrupt upfield. With coaching and more experience, Williams should be able to match the athleticism with the power and become a consistent Pro Bowler with a ceiling that goes even higher than that.",7.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leonard-williams/32005749-4c42-6411-1ceb-16f4ceb749d0
Amari Cooper,"Won't dazzle with blazing speed or outrageous size, but is good in both categories. Complete receiver with game-changing ability to win downfield. Has the skill and twitch to be a consistent, high-volume target in the short and intermediate games with the ability to produce against any coverage. Cooper won't be able to run roughshod over NFL safeties like he did in college, but he should be able to help a passing game improve quickly.",7.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/amari-cooper/3200434f-4f48-7703-16a5-c78426109031
Shane Ray,"It's hard to find many weaknesses for Ray. He pursues the quarterback and the ball like it's his last snap. An alpha male packaged in an explosive frame, Ray has the traits and skills to be a dominant pass rusher and potential Pro Bowler. He also has the athleticism and strength to play in any defensive front.",7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shane-ray/32005241-5942-7102-1e06-2662a8cf1a91
Jameis Winston,"Winston is a big, highly competitive pocket passer who played in a pro-style offense and showed an ability to anticipate throwing windows, scan the entire field and make the NFL throws. His wind-up delivery and marginal mobility outside the pocket are reminiscent of Byron Leftwich, but his arm talent and issues with decision making are more in line with Eli Manning's. Winston's football potential is clearer than so-called ""system"" or ""one-read"" quarterbacks, but every stone must be overturned in an attempt to piece together a predictive character profile on Winston. Winston's supreme confidence might be considered arrogance by some, but even that trait will be alluring to teams who need to find a franchise quarterback.",7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jameis-winston/32005749-4e62-3708-9650-e59a3f7bea83
Arik Armstead,Projection-based prospect with elite size and the traits to become a dominant run-stuffing defensive end in an odd front. Armstead has the explosiveness off the snap and in his jarring punch to gain early advantages and control offensive linemen. Armstead is a fast riser but is still very raw. He will need patience and coaching and must become a more effective pass rusher at some point.,6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/arik-armstead/32004152-4d05-7964-59d3-546e5e96e618
Landon Collins,"Collins is a tempo-setter who can energize a defense with his downhill, aggressive style. He is at his best when he can attack rather than sit back in coverage and process. Collins' tackling, pursuit angles and speed to the sideline can help a defense shut down rushing attacks, but his inconsistencies in coverage will be tested by NFL offenses.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/landon-collins/3200434f-4c62-4212-2ef4-200a7e5884d4
Dante Fowler Jr.,"Strong-side 3-4 outside linebacker with the physical traits and above-average potential to set the edge or spill runs wide to an early demise. Fowler is a competitive pass rusher getting by on athleticism and inside moves right now, but has a Pro Bowl ceiling with double-digit sack potential if he takes coaching and addresses his rush technique.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dante-fowler-jr/3200464f-5738-2785-f81a-f6d367ce1686
Melvin Gordon,"Angular, talented open-field runner who combines outstanding burst with a long stride to gain separation and hit the home run. He won't be able to outrun NFL defenders like he did in college and must develop more feel between the tackles. Gordon shines when his track runs over tackle or around the end and can put a defense to sleep around the corner. Not trustworthy enough to be a three-down back, but his pass-catching improved enough to utilize him out of backfield as a receiver.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/melvin-gordon/3200474f-5227-5321-5a9f-5d54a292e030
Randy Gregory,"A 3-4 outside linebacker with the length, toughness and closing burst to immediately help a run defense. Gregory could stand to add more weight to his frame and needs plenty of technique work and a patient coach for his pass-rush skill to match his traits. High-ceiling, low-floor prospect.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/randy-gregory/32004752-4578-9590-e57a-049e4cdc3700
Todd Gurley,"The rehab work and NFL Scouting Combine medicals will be extremely important for Gurley's draft stock as teams assess his potential durability as an NFL running back. He played less than 40 percent of his team's offensive snaps over the last three years, so there is plenty of tread still on the tires. Has the talent to be a top-five NFL running back, but ACL tear clouds the short-term picture.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/todd-gurley/32004755-5200-0000-f496-e727c8f2225d
Marcus Mariota,"Scheme-based quarterback who will face the same challenges that several quarterbacks before him have faced in terms of learning how to read defenses and go through progressions. The tape was less kind to Mariota than expected, but his size, athleticism and consistency of football character throughout his career are necessary traits in becoming a good-to-great quarterback. Mariota's ability to create outside the pocket will help win games here and there and buy him time as he plies his craft. However, to reach his potential and match the play with the traits, he must develop more poise and feel in the pocket and improve his field vision. Mariota is no lock to be a great NFL quarterback, but his floor is much higher than any of the quarterbacks drafted in 2014.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-mariota/32004d41-5218-6347-2b09-64276fa61f68
Brandon Scherff,"Like former Hawkeye Riley Reiff, Scherff has measurables and traits to play tackle in the league but might be better suited to play guard. More powerful than explosive, Reiff is not a scheme-specific talent and can maul or move in run game. Road-grader with pancake-man potential, but has holes in his pass protection that will be exposed on the next level -- especially at tackle.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-scherff/32005343-4813-5412-5c1e-e60f23b4bdde
Danny Shelton,"With his thick frame and powerful upper body, Shelton has moments where he can dominate at the point of attack. He was forced to chase sideline to sideline due to the nature of Pac-12 offenses, but when he faced downhill competition like Stanford, he stepped up. Shelton is an above average interior pass rusher for a man his size thanks to his surprising athleticism. He is a fit in a two-gap scheme and could benefit from playing fewer snaps than he was forced to play at Washington.",6.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/danny-shelton/32005348-4541-1954-277c-fac0cfdab4aa
Vic Beasley,"Projects as 3-4 outside linebacker. Considered one of the best pure edge rushers in the draft, but needs more sophistication to his approach. Has speed and explosion to become an absolute menace for a creative defensive coordinator. High-impact talent but needs to crank up competitive nature in order to reach his potential.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vic-beasley/32004245-4152-8276-63bb-abe605bebca8
Malcom Brown,"Penetrating big man who took a huge step forward as an NFL prospect in 2014. Brown has hand quickness and uses hands like an NFL starter. His instincts and feel off the snap help him to get into the backfield quickly. Some personnel men believe Brown can play multiple spots along the line in a 4-3 or 3-4 defense, which could put him in play for a high number of teams.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malcom-brown/32004252-4f55-0723-88db-61e509bef186
A.J. Cann,"Consistent four-year starter for the Gamecocks. He has technique issues that need to be coached up in pass protection, but he also has the talent to improve in that area. Powerful drive-blocker who uses leverage to fire out and generate instant movement in tight spaces. He is best-suited to a power scheme. Cann has the plug-and-play traits that could make him an instant starter.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a-j-cann/32004341-4e36-4949-5f30-831832b20b7c
T.J. Clemmings,"Like Duane Brown, Clemmings played high school basketball and was a late switch to the offensive-tackle position in college. There are holes in his protection technique that are no sure-thing to be fixed, but they are coachable. Clemmings will continue to learn the position and improve. He has the physical traits to become a Pro Bowl left tackle if he can handle the move to that side.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-clemmings/3200434c-4537-9799-2c12-89c1b1ae0b2a
Tevin Coleman,"His violent running style is a joy to watch, but might have to be tempered to extend his career. He is a ""race car in the red"" on just about every snap and refuses to give in, which leads to many big runs. Zone, gap, power ... it doesn't really matter because Coleman can fit all schemes. Has the burst and top-end speed to be a game-changing running back for a team looking for a workhorse.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tevin-coleman/3200434f-4c35-9050-eb7e-20c726e53f5b
La'el Collins,Lumbering brawler who has had a level of success in hyper-competitive SEC West. Lacks athleticism to be a consistent left tackle and will have to move to right tackle or bump inside to guard. Collins plays with a mean streak that is evident in every game and could come in and start right away in a power running game as a guard.,6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/la-el-collins/3200434f-4c62-2930-5ec3-8f5e38e5e458
Jalen Collins,"Immensely talented cornerback who brings the entire triangle (height, weight, speed) with him. Still learning technique and how to sink his feet with his eyes, but the instincts and athleticism to make plays on the ball both short and deep are what set him apart. Collins is a work in progress, but his physical and play traits create a very high ceiling if he continues to learn to play the position.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-collins/3200434f-4c60-4473-d9ef-8175d6bfbbbe
Paul Dawson,Outrageously productive linebacker with a nose for the ball. Dawson averages a tackle every 5.3 snaps and either caused or recovered a total of 8 turnovers during the 2014 season. Evaluators understand that Dawson has been a handful while at TCU and that will turn some teams off to him completely. Dawson can play inside in a 2-gap scheme but is a natural fit at 4-3 WILL.,6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/paul-dawson/32004441-5769-5489-ff9b-43387cb78aeb
Eddie Goldman,"His power at the point of attack and ability to discard blockers and actually make plays rather than just eating space will have 3-4 teams very excited about their potential nose guard of the future. However, his lack of pass-rushing prowess could limit just how high he rises on draft boards.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eddie-goldman/3200474f-4c21-6018-6732-763c50e6532e
Benardrick McKinney,"Productive, steady performer in the middle with above-average size and length for the position but below-average agility. McKinney plays within the scheme and finds himself near the play frequently. He plays with strength and has an ability to take on offensive linemen and get downhill to finish his tackles. McKinney looks like an above-average NFL inside linebacker who could become part of a really good defense. He lacks star-making talent, though.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/benardrick-mckinney/32004d43-4b46-5206-e14b-00bea34693a2
DeVante Parker,"Parker won't win the NFL Scouting Combine, but he will win when the ball is in the air. With his height and an exceptional wingspan (80 inches), he consistently catches everything in his vicinity. Parker isn't going to overpower cornerbacks and he will have more contested catches than most explosive wideouts. Parker has consistently posted eye-popping yards-per-catch numbers during his time at Louisville. Parker needs time to get into his routes and his talents would be on full display in a West Coast passing attack.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devante-parker/32005041-5222-6609-dc38-38b3aae27410
Andrus Peat,"Big and powerful with a right tackle's play strength and demeanor, but enough foot quickness to protect on the left side. Peat has the physical tools to be an upper-echelon run blocker with pass-protection ability, but he needs to improve his technique in order to protect with consistency. Peat has been well-coached and is one of the most game-ready offensive linemen in this year's draft.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrus-peat/32005045-4170-9791-95bc-3fdcb6ed04c1
Jordan Phillips,"Nose tackle with desired height, weight and speed. Flashes talent necessary to project a ceiling as a dominant run stuffer best suited for a 3-4 defense. Phillips' ability to eat up blocks should help him earn a high grade, but it's his potential as a big athlete with above-average range for the position that could turn him into a Pro Bowl nose.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-phillips/32005048-4938-6190-4549-4deed276dff3
Shaq Thompson,"Long, twitchy 4-3 outside linebacker with outstanding range to become a highly restrictive defender able to make plays well outside of his area against both the run and pass. With his big-play potential, Thompson could become a unique chess piece in the hands of the right defensive coordinator. He can help on special teams right away and might start off as a sub-package player while he fills out his frame.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaq-thompson/32004752-4557-3058-1e14-49205886a081
Trae Waynes,"He's a bump-and-run cornerback with the length, deep speed and confidence to handle himself down the field against speed. Waynes plays too handsy for NFL officials and that could show up on Sundays due to his lack of great feet and suddenness. He needs technique work and could be inconsistent early on, but he has a very high floor.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trae-waynes/32005741-5946-9703-24d5-cb3af8dc528d
Kevin White,"He's not just a product of West Virginia's system -- he's talented. White competes hard for the ball and has the leaping, hands and high-pointing ability to be a factor down the field despite his lack of top-end speed. His improvement from 2013 to 2014 is a great sign, but his 40 time could define his draft stock.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-white/32005748-4931-5610-215b-b964ae29e7ed
P.J. Williams,"Cover cornerback with the talent to play on an island, and the swagger to regroup and forget when beaten. Williams can cover outside or from the slot, and has potential to come in and start right away for an aggressive man-cover defense. With consistency of effort, Williams could become the best cornerback to come out of this draft.",6.7,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/p-j-williams/32005749-4c40-7276-4dee-b3c381ade0e9
Ameer Abdullah,"Despite having first-round talent, Abdullah's lack of preferred NFL size and issues with ball security might cause some teams to shy away from him in the opening round. Abdullah has explosive potential as a runner and ball-catcher and is a natural zone-scheme fit. His high character will make him a hit during interview process.",6.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ameer-abdullah/32004142-4464-7726-b649-e09413abd27c
Jay Ajayi,"While the comparison to Marshawn Lynch might be a little much considering Lynch's exploits in the NFL, Ajayi's running style and body type are very similar to Lynch's and Ajayi features an improving stiff arm and physicality that has become Lynch's calling card. Ajayi has the ability to play all three downs while mashing in short yardage and near the goal line. Scouts have been quietly circling Ajayi as a second-tier running back who offers tremendous value on the second day (Rounds 2-3) of the draft.",6.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jay-ajayi/3200414a-4177-1256-2431-b2af057c0b9d
Michael Bennett,"Bennett is a disciplined, intelligent player who is a fit for teams looking for an upfield disruptor. He relies on his initial burst, hand usage and technique to win at the point of attack. Bennett has the potential to dominate sluggish or weak guards, but might have issues with true power guards in the NFL.",6.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-bennett/32004245-4e00-0000-20b1-9ba821d3737c
Bud Dupree,"Dupree is an explosive, powerful athlete with a background in basketball. While he's been productive at Kentucky, his tape doesn't always do his potential justice. He must continue to improve as a pass rusher, but his traits are undeniable. Difference between being good and great might be his coordinator.",6.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bud-dupree/32004455-5050-7860-af18-e6f8e2611e65
Ereck Flowers,"While they have different body types, Flowers will have some of the same strengths and flaws 2014 first-round pick Greg Robinson had coming in. Flowers has the size, feet and talent to be a very good left tackle but he will be a work in progress unless he can eliminate some of the balance issues that could plague him.",6.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ereck-flowers/3200464c-4f32-5059-e3ba-462fb5fe315e
Cedric Ogbuehi,"NFL evaluators are very worried about Ogbuehi's core strength and ability to anchor in pass protection, but some of his anchor issues could be improved with technique work -- especially where his hands are concerned. He should be a plus run blocker, especially on stretch plays, but needs to add strength and work on technique if he is to reach his play potential. Based on his traits and his position, he will likely get drafted on projection over production.",6.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cedric-ogbuehi/32004f47-4266-6101-dd5b-dff63b4661d1
Carl Davis,"Davis has the height, weight and length of a first-rounder, but his draft value will be hindered by his lack of productivity as a pass rusher. If Davis can get his overall production to match his talent and traits, he'll have a long NFL career.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carl-davis/32004441-5621-2103-2139-511f8e5bc8e3
Eli Harold,"Explosive, leggy outside linebacker who has surprising strength at the point of attack, and the hands and length to become an outstanding edge-setter. Harold's burst upfield to threaten the edge is pro caliber and his ability to bend the corner at a 45-degree angle creates potential for him to become a quality pass rusher from either outside linebacker spot in a 3-4.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eli-harold/32004841-5223-6127-6dfc-605366401ccf
D.J. Humphries,"An elite-level tackle when he exited the high school ranks, Humphries relies on his superior athleticism and fist-fight mentality rather than an improved skill set and steady technique. He might always have an issue with being a leaner, but his hand placement should improve with more work and coaching. When he improves in that area, he could become a solid NFL starter on the left side.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-j-humphries/32004855-4d72-8022-b4bf-94e3429ecec8
Duke Johnson,"One of the most explosive runners in college football during his time at Miami, Johnson doesn't need much of a crease to make defenses pay. His explosive quickness and elusiveness should help him adapt quickly to NFL speed and his feel and courage as a one-cut runner should earn him instant playing time. Johnson's lack of protection skills and his injury concerns could force him into a committee situation.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/duke-johnson/32004a4f-4800-0009-3d52-7d0c4c49cdd8
Kevin Johnson,"Johnson is a three-year starting cornerback who showed great improvement in man coverage from 2013
to 2014. While he lacks desired weight at the position, his cover skills, athleticism and competitiveness give him a shot to come in and start right away. Johnson can play gunner on special teams.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-johnson/32004a4f-4800-0010-5d6b-1672ed6adf36
Hau'oli Kikaha,"Kikaha is the most accomplished pure pass rusher in this draft class. Relies on a relentless motor off the edge more than athleticism. He has an elite determination to get to the quarterback. While he seems to specialize in just rushing the passer, Kikaha has the power, hands and frame to improve against the run. It might take some work to get fully comfortable as a stand-up 3-4 OLB, but Kikaha is a very safe draft prospect as long as his medicals check out.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hau-oli-kikaha/32004b49-4b05-9326-423d-25b16f1f5d10
Nate Orchard,"Teams will either be wary of Orchard's single season of sack dominance or they will view it as an indicator of growth and potential stardom. Orchard will be below average against the run, but his draft grade and paycheck will be tied to his athleticism and pass-rush talent. If he can develop counter moves, he has big potential. If not, he might be nothing more than a middling, situational pass rusher.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-orchard/32004f52-4326-6972-d177-d7d9cff5c036
Breshad Perriman,"Rare combination of size, top-end speed and suddenness that can be found in some of the best receivers in the game. His routes are sloppy and a work in progress, but his hands keep him out of the top tier of receivers. His drops will drive teams crazy, but his physical traits and ability to hit the big play should warrant early round consideration.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/breshad-perriman/32005045-5244-0170-6920-f60eb457c1fb
Quinten Rollins,"Rare start-stop-start suddeness. His ability to change gears instantly gives him a chance to develop into a talented cover cornerback.

Jaelen Strong,"Individual elements of Strong's game aren't awe-inspiring, but scouts really love the entirety of his game and where it is headed. His strength, size and ability to catch contested throws will be coveted by some, but his issues with separation quickness can only be solved if he becomes much better in his route-running. Strong looks the part of a physical, possession receiver with a relatively high floor.",6.3,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaelen-strong/32005354-5262-7834-4806-c3368d0cc97b
Ronald Darby,"Cover corner with average size and outstanding speed. Has shown the instincts to play off coverage and the athleticism to play press. It is a bit of a concern that scouts and even opposing coaches have commented on Darby's toughness, but he doesn't have very many missed or broken tackles on his docket and his cover skills should be prioritized over his run support regardless. He clearly has starter's ability at the position.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronald-darby/32004441-5218-7187-9a66-cb54872359ea
Phillip Dorsett,"Dorsett is an ascending prospect who has averaged more than 25 yards per catch since 2012. He can challenge teams vertically inside or outside and he has home-run potential after the catch as a slot receiver. With smaller wide receivers like T.Y. Hilton and Antonio Brown proving that small and fast can win in the NFL, Dorsett should be coveted by more than one team and has the potential to turn into a star in the NFL.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/phillip-dorsett/3200444f-5248-8199-3ca5-f2de722dd057
Lorenzo Doss,"Doss is a thin but functionally strong cornerback with an overriding desire to compete for every ball thrown his way, which led to 33 passes defensed and 15 interceptions during his three-year stint at Tulane. He wasn't challenged very often in 2014 and his long speed will be revealed in his workouts, but his ball skills and ability to flip the field should gain him additional attention from general managers.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lorenzo-doss/3200444f-5325-7736-17fd-79ce270b66fb
Cameron Erving,"Former defensive lineman who is still learning the nuances of offensive-line play after just two seasons as a starter. Has the length and foot quickness to play tackle, but film work shows that he will have a much more successful career at center. Possesses skill set and temperament to show rapid development, but might need a year or two of seasoning.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-erving/32004552-5628-8583-d854-14a2bec5e2b8
Jake Fisher,"If you are a zone-based team looking for an athletic, well-schooled tackle who can come in and compete for a starting position right away, then Fisher is your guy. He has the feet to play the left side and is savvy enough in the run game to man the right side. He needs more weight on his frame, but guard is also an option for Fisher.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-fisher/32004649-5338-5760-300e-eeea80770208
Senquez Golson,"Golson has the twitch, ball skills and instincts to be an outstanding cornerback in the NFL. Despite playing so much zone in college, there is no reason to believe he can't transition to any coverage asked of him. He's well put-together, but his lack of height could force some teams to view him as a slot-only corner. Golson has Pro Bowl potential.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/senquez-golson/3200474f-4c68-8554-dbdd-0620f7fd93fa
Hroniss Grasu,"While Grasu isn't a powerful center, he does display enough functional strength and movement skills to be able to assimilate into any offensive philosophy. Grasu can play bigger than his listed size and while he doesn't possess any overwhelming qualities or traits, there aren't any glaring holes in his game that should derail him. His leadership and winning pedigree should be a plus with GMs.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hroniss-grasu/32004752-4153-3780-5745-cf83fbd417e7
Dorial Green-Beckham,"Long-strider with vertical ability to change a game and the catch radius and body control to make the difficult look easy. However, Green-Beckham struggles against physical cornerbacks, and is raw as a route runner with poor instincts when it comes to getting open. It's easy to bet on the traits when a receiver has high football character and is a willing worker, but teams could pass on the traits early in the draft due to his perceived lack of work ethic and overall character.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dorial-green-beckham/32004752-4539-8545-9fb3-9dd6e75ec02a
Rashad Greene,"Very productive in big games and at big times. Greene has the athleticism and quicks to get open and has a natural smoothness in his routes. He might get pigeon-holed into a slot position, but that might not be a bad thing. Greene needs more route polish but should be able to compete for snaps right away.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashad-greene/32004752-4503-1322-662d-4522310ef9ef
Jarvis Harrison,"Dancing bear who possesses the talent, technique and physical traits to be a high-end NFL starter. Not asked to fire out on defenders often in Texas A&M scheme, so that might be an area where he has room for growth. Teams might have to decide between the film and the football character when slotting him.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jarvis-harrison/32004841-5260-1343-921b-425de0f5c023
Rob Havenstein,"Three-year starter who doesn't look the part in his uniform, but teams should worry more about how the dish tastes rather than how it is plated. With surprising feet to pair with good length and balance, Havenstein has the tools to be a starting right tackle in the league. He will be adequate when asked to zone block, but he can fire out and use his hips to leverage defenders out of run lanes.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rob-havenstein/32004841-5624-9308-acd1-fccd83685d9c
Danielle Hunter,"Hunter isn't as heavy as Jason Pierre-Paul, but he has similar length, explosiveness and potential. The concern with Hunter is that his pass-rush instincts are marginal and he hasn't learned to use his physical advantages to rush the quarterback more consistently. Hunter's floor is high thanks to his overwhelming physical traits and motor, but his ceiling will only go as high as the level of coaching he is able to incorporate.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/danielle-hunter/32004855-4e52-9240-4ef3-07ebfed3439a
Tre Jackson,"Three-year starter on a line full of wide-bodies, Jackson entered the 2014 season as one of the top-rated guard prospects, but failed to distinguish himself. Has the talent to be a dependable, quality NFL starter, but he needs to work on weight and conditioning in order to improve his feet and reach his potential.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-jackson/32004a41-4360-3371-299c-140fd942e16f
Grady Jarrett,"Jarrett is built like a refrigerator, but he's hardly a stationary player. He lacks the overall size to be considered as a nose by most base 3-4 teams, but he's a perfect shade-nose fit for teams looking for a disruptor in a one-gap, penetrating front.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/grady-jarrett/32004a41-5225-4349-33b2-d2f5008fd3a4
Eric Kendricks,"Kendricks is an intelligent leader with high football character. Scouts don't see the same explosiveness in Eric as they see in his brother Mychal (Eagles LB), but they do see the same level of production and desire. Eric Kendricks plays with plus instincts against the run and pass. He has the athleticism and demeanor to be an impactful, productive outside linebacker in a 4-3 for years to come.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-kendricks/32004b45-4e10-1224-7c6e-cc615bedb57b
Lorenzo Mauldin,"Known for strong mental makeup, Mauldin is expected to check all of the character boxes, according to scouts. Productive pass rusher with a knack for beating tackles inside. Finds the ball quickly and chases against the run. Very active, productive collegiate player.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lorenzo-mauldin/32004d41-5546-4116-8c22-8930e8a0fa1c
Vince Mayle,"Evaluators seem sure that Mayle is a moldable piece of clay who can become substantially better as a pro with more coaching and experience. Mayle clearly needs work with some of the basic fundamentals for the position, but with his size and an ability to win vertically, he has a high ceiling. He might need a redshirt year before he is ready to contribute consistently.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vince-mayle/32004d41-5956-4719-a2c6-8b07ab38bc55
Owa Odighizuwa,"Odighizuwa has some scheme versatility, but he's not necessarily a versatile player. Some scouts believe that he could open some eyes with his straight-line speed in his workout, but his marginal pass-rush skills and average athleticism could stunt his draft stock.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/owa-odighizuwa/32004f44-4923-7308-b985-7c9a5b76e966
Denzel Perryman,Early down linebacker who can make plays against the run but will struggle if isolated in coverage.  Perryman is a lunch-pail worker who enjoys the physical part of the game. Can be a highly productive NFL player but ceiling looks to be limited.,6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/denzel-perryman/32005045-5277-5462-491f-9c5c82a7d666
Marcus Peters,"Talented cover cornerback with size, ball skills and the confidence NFL teams are looking for, but lacks the necessary discipline and maturity on the field and in practice. Peters has raw talent, but is far from a polished cornerback, and that is without taking the character concerns into consideration.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-peters/32005045-5415-4864-366d-5c634e007d05
Bobby Richardson,"Richardson's tape is full of plays and near plays thanks to his outstanding pursuit and his ability to shed and find the ball quickly. While he lacks the desired height to play defensive end in an odd front, his length and outstanding work with his hands give him a shot at that spot. He has enough strength and room for more bulk to project inside in an upfield 4-3 defense. Richardson's athleticism and hand usage make him an ascending prospect with starter potential.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bobby-richardson/32005249-4339-0816-1d20-e7bb671293d6
Derron Smith,"Lacks ideal size for the position, but checks off just about every other box teams will be looking for. Smith's ability to match up in space against slot receivers and his willingness to get downhill and tackle will be coveted. Smith must learn to play under control as a tackler, but he should have a shot to come in and compete for a starting-safety or slot-corner job quickly.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derron-smith/3200534d-4920-1550-a21f-0d3b6d095fd0
Devin Smith,"Smith isn't just combine-fast, he's game-fast and he would have had more than 12 touchdown catches during the 2014 season if he didn't have to slow down and wait on throws so often. Smith has the feet and hips to become much more than a deep-ball specialist and should be able to step right into a gunner spot on special teams. He still needs to learn his craft and improve his hands, but he has rare speed to score from anywhere on the field.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devin-smith/3200534d-4920-2710-5876-087c34c4a942
Clive Walford,"A combo tight end who can help a team in the running game and through the air, Walford can be moved around the field. He lacks the elite athletic traits to be a game-changer at the position, but he is becoming a premium blocker. With teams looking for versatile TEs to create matchups in two-TE sets, Walford's stock should be high.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clive-walford/32005741-4c06-2390-2654-cc20c29541f6
Maxx Williams,"Pass-catching, move tight end with straight-line play speed and an ability to stretch defenses deep. Williams comes from NFL bloodlines and has the self confidence often found in a former player's son, but he needs to improve his route running in order to become a more complete receiving threat. Williams led all college tight ends with 9 explosive catches (25-plus yards) in 2014 and should be an early target for teams looking for pass-catching weapons.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/maxx-williams/32005749-4c43-6992-2dfb-9b194082fb36
Gabe Wright,"Teams have an issue with his lack of production in 2014, but his initial burst off the snap can't be dismissed. Wright has been in a defensive-line rotation at Auburn over the last two seasons, but has never really shown an ability to be a run-stuffer. Wright is a fit in a penetrating scheme, but he must continue to improve as a pass rusher.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gabe-wright/32005752-4926-9524-17aa-ad5b9fe104bc
T.J. Yeldon,"Instinctive, athletic running back who has the foot quickness to create for himself when lanes constrict or blocks are missed. Yeldon lacks the ball security, top-end speed and desired tackle breaking to be a full-time starter. He's a versatile, rotational back with the ability to step in and step up.",6.2,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-yeldon/32005945-4c06-0186-cd0f-a93c74a0d6a6
Nelson Agholor,"Intelligent, instinctive receiver with an advanced feel for getting himself open against zone coverage and off man. He's lacking a speed component to force cornerbacks to respect him over the top and he might not be physical enough to play outside. Agholor's best position could be working from the slot as a reliable possession receiver who can step right into the punt-returner job on Day 1.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nelson-agholor/32004147-4847-4619-b8a1-bb6c688fe5ac
Henry Anderson,"Data driven teams will be intrigued by Anderson's stuffs, impact tackles and total pressures, but the tape doesn't validate his potential to produce these numbers on the pro level. The body type screams 3-4 defensive end if he can bulk up and add power, but he might lack the balance and toughness to make it there. Anderson might just be a ""tweener"" without a clear NFL position fit.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henry-anderson/3200414e-4428-7484-fe5c-ce7b869feb75
Alex Carter,"Physical cornerback who's at his best when he's able to see the play develop in front of him rather than having to lock down a target as a man-to-man cover corner. Carter's ability to tackle and play the ball in space should interest zone defenses, but a transition to safety might make sense if he can carry a bit more weight.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-carter/32004341-5260-8019-b43d-f7eccabb44e3
Sammie Coates,"Big, fast and raw. Vertical wide receiver with the ability to hit big plays and have dominant games. Coates must be coached to trust his quarterback and run through his deep routes in order to reach his potential. He has early round traits and late-round receiving skills right now, but the upside will be hard to pass on and could pay off in a big way. He will be tethered to the JUGS machine in rookie camp.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sammie-coates/3200434f-4166-7430-70fc-ba07ffbf2772
Stefon Diggs,"Doesn't possess the strength or long speed to make a living as an outside receiver, but he can be an extremely effective weapon from the slot as a pro, turning short third-down throws into first downs. Diggs can make things happen when he has the ball in his hands and could become a consistent, productive weapon for the right offensive coordinator.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stefon-diggs/32004449-4721-8895-fc23-d2bf4c921bd4
Mario Edwards,"He's a 3-4 defensive end or a 4-3 defensive tackle who has to make a living playing the run. Edwards failed to reach expectations while at Florida State and ended his career as a core defender rather than dominant force. His ""level of ability"" is higher than his current level of play and could continue to be the case unless he finds more passion and effort from snap to snap.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mario-edwards/32004544-5760-8536-a1c3-95e3f84a11b2
Ifo Ekpre-Olomu,"Ekpre-Olomu's height and knee issue are likely to take him off the board as a first-round prospect for many defenses. However, what he lacks in measurables, he makes up for with production, natural ability and confidence. He might lack the size teams want from an outside cornerback, but he's more than capable of playing in the slot and playing press, off or zone effectively. Unfortunately for Ekpre-Olomu, the knee injury could hurt his draft stock.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ifo-ekpre-olomu/3200454b-5056-3610-9f35-daf01081f45a
Kyle Emanuel,"Small-school prospects often come with inflated statistics, but Emanuel's tape shows a combination of motor and skill that should be respected inside NFL buildings once he's studied closely. Emanuel has the leverage and hips to get under tackles and turn the corner, but his explosion off the snap will be tested. With his foot quickness and surprising lateral agility, there might be defensive coordinators willing to give him a shot as a 4-3 SAM linebacker.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-emanuel/3200454d-4141-2803-398f-3c678a380ab3
B.J. Finney,"Some evaluators will get caught up on Finney's lack of athleticism, but his hand strength, body composure and ability to stymie athletic interior players with power should not be discounted. These traits will have NFL offensive-line coaches giving him a plug-and-play starting grade.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/b-j-finney/32004649-4e60-0441-71dc-9506e6eb93cf
Trey Flowers,"While he might have room on his frame to add more bulk, he's not as long as most 3-4 teams would like at defensive end. His aggressiveness at the point of attack is a plus, but he might have to come off the field on third downs. Limited athletic traits might affect his draft stock.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-flowers/3200464c-4f57-2739-d4c4-68015d49f058
Devin Funchess,"Has mismatch-caliber size, but lack of vertical talent and below-average hands might negate the size to an extent. Funchess was used outside and inside at Michigan and had success from the slot. He has the feel of a hybrid player who can be a big guy at wide receiver or a mismatch nightmare as a move tight end with more weight on his rangy frame.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devin-funchess/32004655-4e40-5541-3ae9-16d8a3a4b0c1
Charles Gaines,"Field corner in college who plays with a great deal of confidence and alertness, processing with above-average instincts. Looks for chances to jump telegraphed throws. Gaines has a thinner frame than desired and will have teams running at him to see if he'll come up and tackle. His cover skills underneath are near the top of this draft class, but he gave up a few open looks on deep balls and that could cause concern for NFL teams.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charles-gaines/32004741-4918-6048-7095-3d64ba85f78e
Andy Gallik,"Gallik won't win many footraces and he might not look as good in the uniform as some others will, but he's a street fighter in knee braces and he has the power to handle himself when covered by a 3-4 front. Starting-caliber center in a power running game.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andy-gallik/32004741-4c63-4120-3a4b-bc1b0303b494
Marcus Hardison,"A defensive end turned three-technique in a 4-3 defense with outstanding initial quickness off the snap and the hands and feet to be a disruptive, upfield player against plodding guards. Hardison needs more muscle in his lower body and is unlikely to fit defensive schemes looking for stack-and-shed interior defenders. Hardison has starting potential and might be able to come in as a situational pass rusher early on.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-hardison/32004841-5206-3200-1f69-9737084e50d5
Anthony Harris,"Productive three-year starter with above-average instincts and football intelligence. Was an interchangeable safety, playing both deep and in run support, but lacks the bulk, physicality and sure tackling to make a living in the box in the NFL. Harris has some coverage limitations in man, but his skills will get him drafted and should also earn him a starting spot fairly quickly.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-harris/32004841-5233-9211-38c7-6c0c9c19cf19
Brett Hundley,"Hundley flashes athleticism and talent, but his basic quarterbacking issues will take time to improve. In 2014, more than 54 percent of his pass attempts were from six yards and in, including 29 percent from behind the line of scrimmage, which is nothing like an NFL offense. Hundley is a ""flash"" prospect who shows the physical tools to be a starter, but his internal clock and issues with reads and progressions must be improved to give him a shot at becoming a decent NFL starter.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brett-hundley/32004855-4e00-5842-84a4-69c45c54602d
Tyler Lockett,Highly competitive with a history of production at Kansas State. Utilizes great routes and suddenness out of his breaks to get consistent separation. Lockett is a film rat who can come in and compete for a slot receiver spot right away and should be an NFL punt returner.,6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-lockett/32004c4f-4342-0915-1af7-ec50f437887c
Shaq Mason,"Powerful player with an ability to drive defenders off their spot with leg drive and then torque and finish with strong hands and upper body. Lack of height and arm length could hurt his draft standing a little bit, but his elite power trait as run blocker and solid pass-protection technique make him a future starter at right guard in the NFL.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaq-mason/32004d41-5323-7768-d4ec-0e86b8431bf1
Josue Matias,"Three-year starter on a well-schooled, talented offensive line. Teams will covet Matias' length and pass-protection traits, as he has the build of a tackle. He uses technique over power. The question is whether he has the hips and athleticism to incorporate more explosiveness in run blocking and improve against change of direction. High-end potential, but not a lock to reach that potential.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josue-matias/32004d41-5429-1058-9426-e39c364a809f
John Miller,"Miller isn't the most nimble athlete at the guard position and he will be limited by scheme fit, but the pure power in his upper body and his hands have scouts excited and there is a belief that he will be better as a pro than he was in college.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-miller/32004d49-4c33-0317-c67c-f7636112a4a0
Ty Montgomery,"Montgomery is a likable person with high character and an ability to leave a positive impression in draft interviews, but teams will still have to figure out how they want to use him. His hands might not be trustworthy enough to be part of a three-wide-receiver set. Montgomery can flip fields and change games with his ability in the return game and might be best-utilized in a dynamic, open-minded offensive system that gets the ball in his hands quickly and allows him to use his run after catch talents.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ty-montgomery/32004d4f-4e67-7133-aabc-f8fd3a30b39d
Thomas Rawls,"Compact, powerful running back who runs just as powerfully on his 35th carry (back-to-back games of 40 carries) as he does to start the game. While he finishes with brute force, he possesses the vision and lateral movement of a finesse runner. He is more than capable of handling a starter's workload in the NFL, and had Purdue's safeties ready to tap out by the end of that game last season. His character must be vetted carefully, but the tools and the talent are those of a league starter.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/thomas-rawls/32005241-5744-0791-8a53-7397fa6fe147
Ty Sambrailo,"Evaluators are all over the map on Sambrailo, but I feel like he is an interesting litmus-test player this season. While the feet and movement are pluses, his functional strength could be a hindrance to NFL success. Sambrailo must develop more anchor and power to go with his athleticism or he will get taken advantage of by bull-rushers and edge-setters.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ty-sambrailo/32005341-4d00-9394-76fa-4e49decab13a
D'Joun Smith,"Smith possesses above average ball skills and instincts, but questions about his ability to keep up with vertical speed could push his draft stock down a little bit. Smith's cleanest fit might be in a Cover 2 scheme, but he has starting talent.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-joun-smith/3200534d-4920-6823-3891-16ba687f3476
Preston Smith,"Smith has been a solid, rotational defensive end for Mississippi State, but nothing too special. When studying tape long enough, you see traits and potential. With his long arms, plus hands and ability to play the run, Smith could be an interesting prospect inside or in a hybrid 3-4 front. As a 4-3 defensive end, he lacks the twitch to be an impact player.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/preston-smith/3200534d-4957-6520-2f34-43aab9b8dc7b
Jaquiski Tartt,"Tartt has terrific size and is a physical tackler but he must show that he can handle coverage responsibilities. Despite playing 2-deep and single-high coverage, Tartt's size and aggressiveness as a tackler might be best utilized around the line of scrimmage or in a ""robber"" scheme. Tartt has the size, athleticism and overall talent to be an NFL starter.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaquiski-tartt/32005441-5268-6527-eacd-fb913b2b03a0
Laken Tomlinson,"Tomlinson has treated defenders like a squat rep at times, but getting defenders centered and jacked will be tougher in the NFL. His lack of athleticism is a major concern and will cause problems winning initial engagements as defenders will get into him first. Tomlinson's lack of preferred physical traits and a go-to skill set leads me to believe he's more suited to be a backup than full-time NFL starter.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/laken-tomlinson/3200544f-4d68-7650-bb9d-0a43fc8e509c
Daryl Williams,"Williams is a competitive player with all the football character you want and NFL power to match. When he gets defenders lined up in his sweet spot, he can drive them out of the play. Winning with guile and toughness over skill, Williams' lack of functional athleticism is a concern and might be a catalyst for a move inside to guard.",6.1,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daryl-williams/32005749-4c20-8701-502e-fbb04b54af5b
Kwon Alexander,"Productive two-year starter who registered 90 tackles during 2014 season thanks to above-average speed and a desire to stick his nose into as many plays as possible. Alexander's lack of instincts were ill-suited in the box, as he was too easily confused by the misdirection of offenses he faced. He's an outside 'backer with a chance to become a starter in a 4-3 defense. He can come in and play on special teams right away.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kwon-alexander/3200414c-4549-2854-f885-6d7eef402584
Adrian Amos,"Amos checks all the boxes when it comes to strong football intelligence, a willingness to digest tape and cover skills. The biggest question is whether or not he can fit with a coordinator looking for playmakers and chance-takers. He must prove that he can play with greater overlap. Amos' scheme versatility is a big plus, but I wouldn't ask him to play inside the box very often.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/adrian-amos/3200414d-4f56-8523-8f18-fd9451b140ba
Rory Anderson,"Anderson's athleticism and play speed is what NFL teams dream of when looking for tight ends to threaten vertically and create matchup problems underneath. While he needs to add more weight to his frame, Anderson shows the blocking fundamentals to be considered a legitimate combination tight end in the NFL. Anderson's biggest concern on draft day and beyond looks like it could be his recurring triceps injuries.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rory-anderson/3200414e-4449-0104-9b8b-f9f15fee610c
Dres Anderson,Must work on becoming a reliable pass-catcher since he doesn't have the explosive traits for teams to overlook inconsistent hands. Anderson flashes great play speed when the ball is in the air and has the intangibles to become a good backup with low-end starting potential.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dres-anderson/3200414e-4419-6249-d76e-5ba95069e6d3
Stephone Anthony,"Anthony has the athleticism to be an NFL linebacker, but he's not an explosive talent. He tries to get downhill and make plays, but more often it feels like he's guessing rather than instinctive. He'll take high-risk chances that will turn some coaches off. Anthony can make it in the league but he might be more of a depth-chart player than a long-time starter.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stephone-anthony/3200414e-5420-4590-5aef-35279f555ea6
Cameron Artis-Payne,"Doesn't have much tread off the tires since arriving to Auburn from junior college. Has proven that he can hit the turbo button and get through creases, but lacks special traits and ability to max out carries. Artis-Payne is a tough runner but I question if he has enough athleticism to be anything more than a grinder and average backup.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-artis-payne/32004152-5438-7205-b9ec-41e76cfc932f
Kenny Bell,"Lanky, vertical wide receiver with a second gear. He likes to lull cornerbacks to sleep before hitting the gas and getting over the top of them for big plays. Bell is a little more straight-lined than some teams are looking for, but with reliable hands and an ability to make plays on the ball down the field, he has starter's traits as a potential No. 2 WR in the league.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-bell/32004245-4c43-1552-33bc-26093fde0efd
Imoan Claiborne,"Confident, ascending press-cover cornerback with the foot quickness and hips to match receivers off the line of scrimmage and in tight quarters. He's a willing tackler with decent recovery burst, but his questionable long speed and lack of premium size could turn him into a solid slot corner in the league.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/imoan-claiborne/3200434c-4104-2007-3da4-b3ab601b891b
David Cobb,"Cobb's YouTube highlights might bore you, but he's custom-made for physical running teams. He has one-cut traits and can play in a gap scheme. Adjusting his style to the speed of the NFL game might take some time, but Cobb's downhill, run-finishing style fits what running games are becoming again and he has a shot to be more than just a complementary back.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-cobb/3200434f-4214-1451-fb68-cb1e508304a2
Chris Conley,"Tall receiver lacking blazing speed but showcasing enough acceleration to create separation when challenging upfield. Conley displays a natural feel for the position and has hand strength and body control to make tough, contested catches. Lacked gaudy numbers in run-heavy Georgia offense, but his productivity per catch will certainly be noticed by NFL teams -- especially if he has good timed speed at the NFL Scouting Combine.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-conley/3200434f-4e23-6839-29a1-a288b71f08e0
Xavier Cooper,"Cooper must play in a penetrating defensive front in order to minimize his lack of length and maximize his above-average athleticism. He lacks the power to muscle up and hold his ground, but his ability to win with his hands and be a disruptive pass rusher could offer him immediate value as a rotational defensive tackle with a shot to become a starter.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xavier-cooper/3200434f-4f81-4748-9fc4-baffe8e0e855
Christian Covington,"Rotational defensive tackle with functional power and enough initial quickness to play in an odd or even front. Covington has played just two years of college football after missing almost the entire 2014 season due to a knee injury. Missing an entire year of football and the injury that caused his absence will both be hills to climb, but he's flashed NFL traits and talent previously.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-covington/3200434f-5654-6722-4cea-eba680580832
Rob Crisp,"Hard-nosed, high effort tackle whose feet are always in motion and who has the footwork necessary to match up with speed rushers on the left side. Crisp has limited strength and may not be a fit for teams looking to run the ball with power, but his feet and length give him a shot to become an NFL starter at left tackle.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rob-crisp/32004352-4931-4433-2f4d-1509e0a3329b
Jamison Crowder,Smallish slot wide receiver who will have to win with his quickness and route proficiency. Features point-guard quickness and generally solid hands. Has proven his willingness to compete all over the field despite his lack of size.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamison-crowder/32004352-4f69-7273-6662-7a928881f033
Titus Davis,"Evaluators and teams might focus on Davis' lack of speed, but his ability to win with his routes should not be undersold. Davis has excellent ball skills and foot quickness and could be a terrific fit for a West Coast offense looking for an outside receiver who can make plays near the goal line.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/titus-davis/32004441-5676-8844-86b3-98560ee19e58
Tyeler Davison,"Davison is a powerful defensive tackle who has above-average athleticism and saw his overall production spike in 2014. He is well-conditioned and can play all three downs if called upon to do so. With his athleticism, balance and power, Davison has the potential to be an outstanding pro, but he must prove that he can bring those same traits into play against better competition.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyeler-davison/32004441-5682-2084-103a-cbc0af12078c
Andrew Donnal,"Donnal is limited from an athletic and strength standpoint but understands the nuances of the position and how to play with technique. With an ability to pass protect and experience at both guard and tackle, he should be drafted and has a legitimate shot at making a roster.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-donnal/3200444f-4e46-7175-2cb3-f7d5d50031ae
Kurtis Drummond,"Drummond is a bag of mismatched parts. He has the ball skills and closing burst of a starting NFL free safety, but his instincts and tackling could scare teams away from viewing him as a single-high center fielder. He's not physical enough to play around the line of scrimmage, so his draft position will ultimately rest on how teams weigh his ball skills against his instincts.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kurtis-drummond/32004452-5536-3898-6718-533b419d7618
Mark Glowinski,"Tackle-turned-guard who is still learning to play the position. Lack of bend will cause leverage issues, but he has enough pure upper-body strength to overcome and he has potential to be good in pass protection. The physical traits combined with the toughness and intelligence should give him a shot to become a starter at some point.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mark-glowinski/3200474c-4f73-8436-a1e9-e344d00ab8e6
Markus Golden,"Golden is a square-number pass rusher, meaning there isn't much twist, turn and torque to his game. He comes off the ball with a purpose, but scouts don't see the explosive traits they want from a pass rusher. Golden is primarily an effort and pursuit player with special-teams potential, but he doesn't fill up a stat sheet.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/markus-golden/3200474f-4c06-7489-31ee-cc5aa009aa13
Antwan Goodley,"Goodley is a top-heavy wide receiver with a running back's frame and an ability to make teams pay after the catch. The biggest concern in scouting circles is how quickly he can adapt to NFL routes and how his hands will hold up if he's asked to make his living over the middle of the field in traffic. Goodley isn't the talent that Percy Harvin is, but he can be used in some of the same, creative ways.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antwan-goodley/3200474f-4f27-5616-d714-f1b91e0a2aba
Garrett Grayson,"Grayson went from fringe draft prospect to clearly on the draft board with a strong 2014 season. Despite average arm talent, he uses good lower-body mechanics to generate velocity and his touch and accuracy on deep throws is eye-opening. Grayson needs more tape work to help improve his decision-making, but his size, production and growth at the position have ticked the requisite draft boxes to make him an intriguing mid-round prospect.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garrett-grayson/32004752-4182-4508-7ced-5cbbbf5e5977
Geneo Grissom,"Grissom is still very raw and has plenty of football to learn. Some scouts believe he will test well and improve his draft standing beyond where the tape says it should be. He's not a plus pass rusher, but has draftable traits and an untapped upside. His biggest concern could be finding a true position fit.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/geneo-grissom/32004752-4982-5263-647a-96b44ce15941
LaDarius Gunter,"Has the desired size, length and playmaking qualities to be a starting cornerback but his perceived lack of play speed and inconsistency in man coverage could cause teams to peg him as a zone corner, which might drop him by a round.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ladarius-gunter/32004755-4e70-9450-6dfc-10955039c1f3
Justin Hardy,"Hardy consistently attacks his on-field responsibility with urgency and aggressiveness and he's a very reliable target. With more teams running the ball out of three-WR sets, some coordinators will see value in the way Hardy gets after run-blocking assignments. Hardy must prove that he has the quickness to get separation out of his breaks.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-hardy/32004841-5211-1877-e1fe-326c6e4b66eb
Josh Harper,"Long-waisted wide receiver who is quicker than fast. Harper was a possession receiver at Fresno State and NFL cornerbacks will likely press him to make him win at the line of scrimmage. With work on his routes, Harper has the feet, body control and hands to get open and become a viable NFL target. His ability to make plays after the catch will improve his draft stock.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-harper/32004841-5226-7323-7e0d-e36230a12443
Jeff Heuerman,Heuerman's production fell off in 2014 after dealing with a foot injury and quarterback change. He is a vertical pass-catching tight end who can be moved all over the formation. Scouts seem to be unusually intrigued and excited about Heuerman's NFL potential.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeff-heuerman/32004845-5519-0731-c160-ede9f629ceb1
Jordan Hicks,"Hicks sticks to the script and ""plays through a straw"" -- seeing just what is in front of him -- but he has the necessary size, speed and athleticism to stick in the league. Hicks is an improving player who will live in the film room and might end up overdrafted on the upside potential.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-hicks/32004849-4351-6259-1f9d-4fc42253b5c3
Troy Hill,"Improved by leaps and bounds from last year to this after becoming a full-time starter. Plays with competitive toughness and improving confidence in coverage. Hill has the athleticism and ball skills to be an NFL cornerback, but his slight frame is a substantial concern. Concerns surrounding his off-field character could hurt his draft stock.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/troy-hill/32004849-4c62-6234-c338-b96f6c77b845
Gerod Holliman,"One-year starter at free safety, posting outrageous ball-production numbers. While Byrd is the NFL comparison from a ball-skills standpoint, Holliman doesn't show Byrd's fire or competitiveness. A feast or famine free safety whose lack of field discipline will be more heavily exploited in the NFL, Holliman's ball skills and instincts will surely excite teams, even though his rumored lack of football character could sabotage the talent.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gerod-holliman/3200484f-4c25-4806-8c75-a8f8901c6aab
A.J. Johnson,"His production will jump off the page, but Johnson isn't the high-impact player his tackle numbers might suggest. With average lateral movement and limited twitch, Johnson can be an NFL starter, but is unlikely to be a standout at any point. Off-the-field issues must be monitored as they could sink his draft stock.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a-j-johnson/32004a4f-4804-1096-8699-446a82b664b4
Taiwan Jones,"Physically imposing ""Hulk smash"" linebacker with outstanding power and toughness but a lack of instincts essential to the position. Jones' coverage limitations could be mitigated by his ability to thump and blitz as a 3-4 inside linebacker next to a more instinctive chaser. At worst, Jones is a backup linebacker and core special-teams player.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taiwan-jones/32004a4f-4e73-1462-5fb3-6659b94ac393
Ben Koyack,Underutilized in the passing game while at Notre Dame. Strong understanding and execution as a run blocker with the physical traits to be a tough matchup in the passing game. Still raw as a receiver and will need more individual work with a position coach on the next level. College production belies his pro potential.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-koyack/32004b4f-5956-3976-e7b3-c2a9f1818da5
Tyler Kroft,"Tall, athletic tight end with the frame to add more muscle and the athleticism to get open in space. Kroft is an aggressive blocker who can help the running game win on the edges, but he also possesses the quickness to get open in space and make a play after the catch. Kroft's size, athleticism and competitiveness as a blocker make him a scheme fit for most offenses and he could be one of the top tight ends to come from this draft class.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-kroft/32004b52-4f07-4538-e9e1-c9aaa1853924
Tony Lippett,"The eyeball test doesn't seem to show Lippett as a dangerous wideout, but he consistently beat Big Ten coverage. Long-strider who excels with slants, posts and in-cuts, he needs work to be more well-rounded with his routes. Lippett's production skyrocketed thanks to hard work, confidence and competitive fire. His willingness to accept the challenge at cornerback and play both ways is an example of why Lippett should succeed as a starter in the league.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tony-lippett/32004c49-5024-7808-21f2-c40963e39ac5
Craig Mager,"Productive, consistent four-year starter who plays with the aggressiveness and competitiveness that defensive coordinators will love. Mager has the twitch to close quickly on throws underneath and leaping ability to challenge jump balls. Teams question his ability to carry deep speed, which could impact his draft standing, but his talent and makeup give him a shot at becoming an NFL starter.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/craig-mager/32004d41-4726-3579-b27d-25e52480e159
Greg Mancz,"He needs a year in the weight room, but Mancz is ahead of the game in terms of his understanding of offensive-line play. After playing all three positions, Mancz offers the type of versatility that teams covet, but his average play strength could be a draft-day counter to his versatility. Based on Mancz's tape and history, one would have to expect that he will find a way to succeed in the league.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/greg-mancz/32004d41-4e03-9930-4a16-102f328e9a66
Ali Marpet,"Has the body type and movement of a zone-scheme center with guard potential. Technically sound and has athleticism to become an NFL starter, but must prove he can handle the substantial jump in power and speed he will see.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ali-marpet/32004d41-5229-1946-2d96-54bc1b07e471
Steven Nelson,"Nelson is tailor-made for the Tampa-2 scheme. An aggressive, physical player in run support who can also limit yards after catch underneath, Nelson does his best work in off coverage. As long as he can keep everything in front of him, Nelson should be able to compete for a starting spot in the league.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/steven-nelson/32004e45-4c71-6852-b28f-e8ced332216e
Nick O'Leary,"O'Leary has the competitive spirit and toughness that teams look for in a dual-threat tight end, but he lacks the physical traits. Based on how Florida State used him, he is an easy projection to an H-back spot where he should be an effective move-blocker and pass-catcher.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-o-leary/32004f4c-4505-2702-3294-0c0df0e2d288
David Parry,Underrated former walk-on with a chip on his shoulder and a mean streak to go with it. Rotational defensive lineman with explosive power coming from relatively modest frame by nose tackle standards. Can play in an odd or even front and has strength and functional quickness to be a factor against the run while creating push and pocket disruption against the pass.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-parry/32005041-5270-2152-9e79-7fe18f700697
Darius Philon,"One-gap penetrator with serious juice off the snap. Philon could have used an additional year at Arkansas to add muscle and improve himself as a take-on defensive tackle, but teams will absolutely be intrigued by his combination of get-off and interior-pass-rush potential.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darius-philon/32005048-4967-6018-6db8-5036c14f62f0
Jeremiah Poutasi,"Improving tackle prospect with athletic limitations that could always hamper his ability to consistently protect the passer as a tackle in the NFL. Played from two-point stance at Utah, but could benefit from a move inside to guard, where he can fire out and play forward. Poutasi will have to learn to sustain blocks and play with faster, stronger hands. Learning those things could take time.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremiah-poutasi/3200504f-5568-5229-3120-0e99e1e7165d
Hayes Pullard,"Athletic linebacker who falls into a habit of letting plays come to him rather than making things happen. While lacking an aggressive strike as a tackler, Pullard has the athleticism to be a solid NFL player. He has to find a scheme that can keep him clean or he might be just another linebacker.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hayes-pullard/32005055-4c38-9002-330e-4ce8873ec82f
Damarious Randall,"Randall is considered undersized for the safety position and some teams have him projected as a cornerback. While he has the speed and athletic traits to transition to cornerback, his cover skills and technique need quite a bit of work to be ready for the NFL level. Randall has a nose for the ball and a strong desire to make an aggressive tackle in space, so there could still be teams that give him a legitimate shot at safety, where he carries a higher draft grade.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damarious-randall/32005241-4e05-2747-893f-1a139ed1aa96
Cody Riggs,Watch the tape and his intelligence and toughness immediately stand out. Riggs is a student of the game and displays a field awareness that secondary coaches will covet. The biggest issue for Riggs is that his size might cause some teams to marginalize him and he doesn't have much productivity to hang his hat on. Riggs seems like a perfect fit as a nickel cornerback who can help in run support and who can compete against receivers of all sizes and speeds.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-riggs/32005249-4740-9288-36ee-1f214f7b2b8b
Eric Rowe,"Rowe won't be for everyone. Scouts have concerns about his deep speed and he's not a guy who can match and mirror in coverage. However, Rowe will be a nice fit for defenses looking for a long defender with disruptive downfield traits.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-rowe/3200524f-5733-2230-e44f-b8ef82278f51
Josh Shaw,"While Shaw played boundary corner, slot corner and safety at USC, concerns over his athleticism and speed could limit him to zone-cornerback status as a pro. Shaw seems to go along for the ride while on field rather than operate with a voracious appetite to make plays. He's not physical enough to play in the box, so he will likely have to be a Cover-2 cornerback or free safety as a pro.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-shaw/32005348-4164-1197-1f13-5052489b8352
JaCorey Shepherd,"Borderline height to be an outside cornerback and could be looked at as a slot cornerback. His lack of physicality against the run will hurt him with some teams, but his ball skills and college production over the last two years will catch a lot of eyes and gives him a very good shot at making a roster his rookie season.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacorey-shepherd/32005348-4550-8041-d24c-2cbc1aebaa4e
DeAndre Smelter,"Like Eric Decker, Smelter is a former baseball player with outstanding hand-eye coordination. Both will have entered the draft with questions lingering about a season-ending injury (Lisfranc for Decker). Smelter is an uber-athlete with a background of excellence in every sport he has played. He plays well beyond his experience level at wide receiver. His toughness, natural instincts and football intelligence should earn him a spot on a depth chart, provided there are no lasting effects from his ACL tear.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deandre-smelter/3200534d-4538-7261-1077-b85637ab3e70
Za'Darius Smith,"Effort-oriented power end with a willingness to battle and fight at the point of attack. He's not big enough to play end in a 3-4, so he'll have to become an above-average run thumper as a 4-3 power end.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/za-darius-smith/3200534d-4982-7086-a9ae-e56c38b472b6
J.R. Tavai,"When Tavai hits the grass, he goes all out until the final whistle sounds. Limited athleticism could cause decline in production in the pros and medical concerns have some scouts lowering his draft grade. His energy, effort and enthusiasm from snap to snap are characteristics defensive coordinators will welcome at any stage of the draft.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/j-r-tavai/32005441-5605-4826-b4cb-67a33bffe8e9
Tyrus Thompson,"Thompson has NFL size and flashes NFL potential, but he doesn't play with the consistency or effort that NFL scouts want to see from him. There will be teams that drop his grade due to football character, but tackles that have traits and upside usually get drafted earlier than their draft grades call for.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyrus-thompson/32005448-4f71-7399-5ed0-281c398575b4
Max Valles,"Redshirt sophomore who relies solely on his outstanding athleticism and physical tools rather than an understanding of how to play the game. If Valles can improve his football intelligence while becoming a more skilled pass rusher, then he should be able to unlock his starter's traits and become a quality NFL edge player. In the short term, Valles will require patience and might not be much of a factor in Year 1.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/max-valles/32005641-4c65-0439-a758-b7e70225aa8b
Darren Waller,"Late bloomer who is faster than quick and has coveted size-speed combination. Waller isn't just a tall receiver, he has legitimate hands and body control and can impose his size on mismatched cornerbacks. Waller has a low floor, but with a little more competitive fire and technique work, he could become a legitimate touchdown maker in the league.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darren-waller/32005741-4c50-9040-67d6-042691fb535a
L.T. Walton,High-motor interior lineman who could become a five-technique in a 3-4 defense with more technique work. Walton has the traits to become an above-average player against the run and should be able to play in both odd and even fronts.,5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/l-t-walton/32005741-4c80-8582-5ddc-eb0cabc9eada
Ramik Wilson,"Wilson could use more thump in his game. He will occasionally flash explosiveness, but we don't see it enough. Productive over the last two years, with ability to come in and help on special teams. Attack-
oriented defense could turn Wilson into a more urgent player, but he might have to prove he can be more than just a backup linebacker.",5.9,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ramik-wilson/32005749-4c77-4827-e9cf-910d95cdbed6
Mario Alford,"Plays with straight-line track speed and is a threat to go over the top of the fastest corners if the get too bold. Alford lacks the short-area elusiveness that would push his draft stock higher, but his speed will open underneath catches and he might be impossible to stay with on crossing routes. He offers value as a kick returner, but must be coached to hit it and go rather than dancing. He might be able to play receiver outside in the right scheme.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mario-alford/3200414c-4663-5509-fe5f-824ced008606
Javorius Allen,"Workhorse back able to make plays late in the game and work out of the backfield to keep defenses honest. His relative elusiveness in space and ability to cut on a dime give him the ability to create yards where there are none, but his average vision and inability to finish off runs will keep him from getting some of the yards teams might expect. He's well-rounded enough to be a very good backup with middle-
of-the-road starting potential.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javorius-allen/3200414c-4c46-9092-5c78-2e9c81c3e122
Nick Boyle,"Big tight end with the size and physical traits of a blocking tight end but lacking the proper disposition to specialize in it. The 2013 tape shows a starting-caliber receiving threat. If he can get quicker and put the work in as a blocker, Boyle can be a starting NFL tight end.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-boyle/3200424f-5968-8993-3182-029e039889e7
Malcolm Brown,"North-south runner with a willingness to grab his hard hat and do the dirty work. He's at his best as a high-volume runner who can wear down defenses. He possesses the size, toughness and ability to play on all three downs and that will catch the eyes of teams looking for depth at running back.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malcolm-brown/32004252-4f55-0137-a08a-164e95f5f50c
Jamon Brown,"Intriguing tackle/guard prospect. His mass and athletic limitations are best-suited inside and his quickness off the snap could be an indicator that Brown's best football could be ahead of him. With a wider base and better body control, Brown could become a starting guard or potential tackle in power scheme.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamon-brown/32004252-4f48-5991-4eb2-390cd5f5fede
Trent Brown,"Brown has the pure size to block out the sun, and unlike some players with his bulk, he knows how to use it. He can plow holes as a run blocker, but can only play right guard in a power scheme. His lack of playing experience and conditioning concerns could hurt his draft stock.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trent-brown/32004252-4f73-9325-7786-18cc8995e060
Bryce Callahan,Cover corner who is lacking the play strength to handle NFL receivers on the outside and can be mismatched from the slot against physical players. Suspect run support will make playing in the slot tough as well.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-callahan/32004341-4c52-0433-82de-c4dbdf4e8215
Ibraheim Campbell,"Box safety with some coverage traits that should help him stick with some of the athletic, matchup-based tight ends. He has shown improved consistency as a tackler and has a knack for creating turnovers. He could come in and earn a spot with special-teams play while he tries to develop his instincts over time.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ibraheim-campbell/32004341-4d36-2155-d7f8-f63b6639e61d
Donald Celiscar,"Physical, ball-hawking cornerback who is at his best in bump and run coverage. Celiscar allowed just 35.7 percent of passes his way to be completed in 2014 and posted 33 passes defensed and seven interceptions over last two seasons. His ball skills are no fluke, but his lack of deep speed and fluidity could limit his draft standing and force him into a zone-based defense. It's hard to get a read on his open-field instincts, but it wouldn't surprise to see a team consider him at safety in the pros.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donald-celiscar/32004345-4c39-5705-c359-7968940dfbdf
Gerald Christian,"A competitive, move tight end with an ability to make contested catches that other tight ends will struggle with. While he won't look as natural and fluid as you would expect, the tape shows a guy who can get separation in space. Has traits to be a quality player who brings diversity and toughness to an offense.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gerald-christian/32004348-5235-6457-bede-250b5a7fd8ac
Justin Coleman,"Plays with energy and confidence and is a good finisher in run support. Has desired instincts and awareness in coverage, but lacks athleticism to match up against quicker targets in man coverage. Could be tough to cut based on toughness and ability to play on special teams.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-coleman/3200434f-4c29-4032-6cc8-84e808480389
John Crockett,"Patient, pro-style runner with the potential to be a full-time backup and play on all three downs if asked. Play strength is below average for the position, but he's a creative runner who can find yards on his own and catch the ball out of the backfield.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-crockett/32004352-4f02-8230-4f63-e27e77224e50
Andre Davis,"Stiff-hipped vertical wide receiver with an ability to make the difficult catch, but a propensity to lose focus when challenged. Davis has the talent to challenge for a back-end roster spot, but his competitive nature is being questioned by some teams.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-davis/32004441-5612-2703-90e4-21a1e2f3fd5c
A.J. Derby,"Despite spending only one season at tight end, has the size and tools to become a move tight end who creates matchup issues for defenses. His draft value could be held down due to his lack of experience and below average in-line blocking, but combination of size and play speed should be intriguing to NFL teams.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a-j-derby/32004445-5213-9014-d301-e53b43a66de6
Quandre Diggs,Diggs has started 80 percent of his games during his four years at Texas. He's battle-tested against some of the most explosive wide receivers in the country and has developed into a mentally tough player. Diggs will have to be a slot cornerback and will need to keep his weight down in order to match up with the speed he will see from the slot. Diggs is a Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) draft candidate who can help himself by running well in pre-draft drills.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quandre-diggs/32004449-4720-2845-f69e-20106499f6f6
Reese Dismukes,"Steady four-year starter who was considered a leader in the locker room for Auburn. Is below the acceptable level for quickness, length and size, and his functional strength looks to be just average. Dismukes is a scrappy center who has to win with effort over physical traits.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/reese-dismukes/32004449-5367-7579-58c3-244bcfc8260c
Jamil Douglas,"Douglas gets by with adequate length and plus athleticism, but his play demeanor will have to ramp up in order to make it as an NFL guard. Douglas flashes enough potential to excite teams looking for athletic traits, but his lack of functional power will be hard to overlook for others. Douglas could benefit from a glass-chewing mentor in the NFL.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamil-douglas/3200444f-5540-6284-562c-a0ee444685ea
Kaleb Eulls,Has the athletic ability and motor to be effective against the run and was good enough to start for four years in the challenging SEC West. Eulls needs a great deal of improvement as a pass rusher and some of that improvement can come with better hand usage. Has the look of a competent NFL backup.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kaleb-eulls/32004555-4c38-5627-8de7-9dce7054ab9d
Deshazor Everett,"Has competed against outstanding talent during his time in the Big 12 and SEC. Based on tape, he's on the draft fringe. His desire to be the hero might severely hamper his draft stock, but his ability as a hitter and special-teams player should get Everett a look from a zone-based defense. If he can add bulk, safety might be his fallback position.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deshazor-everett/32004556-4511-5531-b1ea-60bae0447b4f
Tayo Fabuluje,"Huge tackle with natural strength and nimble feet. Played just two years of college football and has had to overcome difficult circumstances in his life. His footwork issues will take time to fix and might still be exploited by NFL defenders. Fabuluje might be best served moving inside, where his strength and short-area movement skills will be viewed as big pluses by offensive line coaches.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tayo-fabuluje/32004641-4265-7101-ce00-b146916bf8b0
Alani Fua,"Angular outside linebacker prospect with impressive burst off the snap. He's in need of more bulk before he can be counted on to take on NFL run blockers. Fua could post impressive numbers at the NFL Scouting Combine, and he is a wild card who can be moved around the field by a creative defensive coordinator, but he still needs time to grow into his tall frame and become a more polished pass rusher.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alani-fua/32004655-4101-6162-5b43-45c1bf9b567a
Max Garcia,"Converted center who has taken reps at tackle and started an entire season at guard. Limited phone-booth mauler with above-average upper-body strength and toughness at the point of attack to play in the NFL. His physical limitations could hurt his draft standing, but his functional strength and potential to swing between center and guard give him a decent shot to make it in the league.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/max-garcia/32004741-5211-2389-dec3-7cff8193581f
Jacoby Glenn,"Thin cornerback who can be a ballhawk when he's in position, but he might have issues sticking with NFL speed. Glenn loves to play and brings everything he's got on every snap. His instincts aren't great, but are serviceable. His ability to tackle with consistency and challenge receivers at the point of contact could earmark him for a spot with a Tampa-2 defense.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacoby-glenn/3200474c-4522-0216-6c3c-56e23bc43109
Doran Grant,"Boundary corner with press responsibilities in college but might lack the necessary size to play outside and athleticism to star in a primarily man-based scheme in the pros. Grant plays the ball well and is smart, with a willingness to tackle. Could be headed to the slot with a more zone-based defense.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/doran-grant/32004752-4141-2011-3bcd-b16d749e2171
Braylon Heard,Scat back with exceptional foot quickness and athleticism. He lacks the size and play strength to handle the rigors of being a first down running back. Heard can mismatch linebackers out of the backfield in the passing game and can create explosive plays as a runner if his blocking is decent. His value to a team will depend directly on scheme.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/braylon-heard/32004845-4131-1945-563c-aabaf04434b7
Ben Heeney,Undersized inside linebacker with a big motor and willingness to take chances. Lacks the athleticism to recover from mistakes in the running game and is too tight to cover in space against the pass.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-heeney/32004845-4529-0361-e4b6-1e7fa36c077a
Austin Hill,"Based on the tape, it's hard to imagine Hill will be able to run a time that will make scouts happy. However, he's a tough blocker and a reliable, big target who can block in the running game. Hill's medicals will be scrutinized, but if healthy, he could use his big frame to muscle smaller slot corners.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-hill/32004849-4c08-7132-9f81-3aea36267760
Mike Hull,Hull is a productive linebacker who might be forced to stay inside due to his lack of athleticism. His size and short arms concern some scouts because they fear he'll get overwhelmed on second level and give up too many big runs. Hull has enough talent to make it in the league as a backup linebacker/special-teams contributor.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-hull/32004855-4c21-3269-4977-b9ce4e57bd7c
David Johnson,"Johnson lacks the short-area quickness to be a consistently effective every-down running back, but he has good size, speed and hands so he can't just be dismissed. He doesn't run routes well enough and isn't sudden enough to be a wide receiver, so he might have to be a third-down back with kick-return potential.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-johnson/32004a4f-4817-4477-4e5f-db6fb5a95abe
Byron Jones,"Instinctive cornerback with good size and adequate speed. Has the ball skills and anticipation needed for the position. Jones' balance and overall athleticism could be a concern in man coverage and his season-ending shoulder injury will need to be examined. He would be an interesting free safety prospect with his instincts, but might lack the physicality for the position.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/byron-jones/32004a4f-4e14-1600-f94c-63eb30910cbc
Matt Jones,"Has very good athleticism for a big running back and is a physical pile-mover who is difficult to stop for negative yardage. Unfortunately, Jones lacks the instincts and vision to fully maximize his physical tools. Jones could become the physical member of a running-back-by-committee approach, with upside as a third-down option.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-jones/32004a4f-4e60-3219-485e-36655170f13d
Arie Kouandjio,"While Kouandjio has been part of a successful team at Alabama, that doesn't mean he is ready to take that next step. At times it's painful to watch Kouandjio try to move in space and he's limited to blocks that are right in front of him. His lack of functional athleticism and versatility will limit his NFL chances.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/arie-kouandjio/32004b4f-5505-0326-33d3-2a972c432b30
Jeremy Langford,"Langford showed improvement from 2013 to 2014, but he doesn't accelerate through contact and will usually get what is blocked. Without an ability to maximize his yards with each carry, teams could peg him as a ""committee back"" with an ability to play on third downs.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-langford/32004c41-4e55-0009-7df2-5868ebab3d73
Eric Lefeld,"Lefeld looks the part, with his confident kick-slide and technically sound hands, but lack of functional strength and length is a concern. With coaching, Lefeld could play with better leverage, but functional power will continue to get him knocked off balance.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-lefeld/32004c45-4633-4308-4b1d-cfc165e7c1f3
Derrick Lott,"Skilled pass rusher who understands the position and was simply too athletic and too talented for most of the competition he faced while at Tennessee-Chattanooga. Is a natural fit as a three-technique in a 4-3 defense, but could garner consideration as a 3-4 defensive end if he can prove he's strong enough.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derrick-lott/32004c4f-5428-9903-f660-8241fbfd99e6
Donatella Luckett,"Has an NFL body and the speed and quickness that offensive coordinators want out on the field, but he has barely scratched the surface of what it will take to make it in the league. Scouts like his work ethic and believe that he will be coachable. He might be a year or two away from making a difference as a receiver, but his kick-return potential could get him on the field sooner.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donatella-luckett/32004c55-4361-9849-66d9-871f709bfd99
Sean Mannion,"Tall, rhythm thrower who shows an ability to play with confidence and accuracy when used as a game manager within an offense featuring a strong rushing attack. Mannion needs plays to stay on schedule or his confidence becomes shaky and the turnovers start rolling in. Mannion lacks arm talent to carry an offense, but has enough ability to become a capable backup.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-mannion/32004d41-4e54-8238-75bc-0c066cdf649e
Nick Marshall,"Intriguing conversion prospect who is moving from quarterback to cornerback in an effort to make it in the NFL. It will take time for Marshall to go from a position of decision-making, patience and processing to one of frenetic energy and high-end athleticism. Marshall flashed at cornerback during Senior Bowl practices and his size will interest NFL teams, but his top-end speed and individual workouts will determine whether he's an NFL cornerback or a name-brand former college quarterback.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-marshall/32004d41-5244-2504-8054-83da4a7a91d5
Tre McBride,"Teams will have to answer questions about his level of ability to get open because he has the art of catching the ball down pat. Vertical speed and separation quickness appear to be average considering his competition level, so teams must figure out whether to keep him outside or utilize his size and toughness over the middle in the slot.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-mcbride/32004d43-4274-3359-9a34-a32802e90c57
Bobby McCain,Undersized slot corner with instincts to anticipate and the twitch and ball skills to do something about it. Much more comfortable processing and attacking from an off position and loses effectiveness when forced to play with his back to the ball. His 19 passes defensed and 11 interceptions over his last 22 starts are indicative of his athleticism and talent to play on the next level but he could be scheme dependent.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bobby-mccain/32004d43-4305-0868-e824-2f8ef4ae600c
Marcus Murphy,"All-purpose running back with a lean frame and a big heart. Showed consistency of effort and production during his time at Missouri. His value as a runner is limited due to his size, but he has the potential to become a legitimate target out of the backfield and might warrant some reps in camp as a slot receiver. Murphy can step in and immediately challenge for the top spot as a kickoff and/or punt returner.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-murphy/32004d55-5251-7528-c408-6a8d935ecd3b
Robert Myers,"Myers is already above average from a technical standpoint and is a quick processor when the game speeds up. Myers is a guard prospect who can pull and play in a power scheme. He has the pass protection traits of an NFL starter. The ceiling is higher for Myers than many guard prospects in this draft, and with more coaching and work in the weight room, he should be an NFL starter.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-myers/32004d59-4551-0693-b442-d8b25482b816
Leon Orr,"Athletic interior lineman with an ability to become a more disruptive penetrator with more coaching and improved technique. He will probably be targeted by one-gap, upfield defenses. His maturity level will be questioned at the NFL Scouting Combine and beyond. The way he handled his situation at Florida could sink his draft prospects, but it shouldn't sink his chance to make a team and become an NFL backup.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leon-orr/32004f52-5234-1795-cda1-c4fdc0aad0c4
Garry Peters,"Schemed dependent cornerback who is best-suited to a bump and run or cover-2 defense due to his length and disruptive nature off the line of scrimmage. Peters doesn't have great play strength and is a willing tackler more than an aggressive hitter, but he plays with desired competitiveness and hasn't allowed a touchdown pass against him over his last 58 targets spanning two years. If Peters can run an average forty yard dash and add some bulk to his frame, he has the potential to become a starter.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garry-peters/32005045-5414-7944-a2fe-a86e36c3fe07
Bryce Petty,"NFL evaluators felt like Petty's senior season was disappointing, but those same evaluators love his size, leadership and intangibles. He needs a year or two of practice time and camp work to learn how to get through his progressions, but has the intelligence to do that. Petty must have a structured offense that won't ask him to make plays outside of the pocket.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-petty/32005045-5474-2461-848b-2154ef923863
Cody Prewitt,"Prewitt is a four-year starter who has been a dependable and productive member of an improving unit at Ole Miss. His size screams ""box safety"" but his play demeanor doesn't. He lacks the athleticism and plus instincts to be a chance-taker at the next level and will likely have to fit with teams as a single-high and Cover 2 safety.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-prewitt/32005052-4579-7704-a287-f398210a1976
Cedric Reed,"Reed never developed into the type of defensive end that Texas expected when it recruited him. Despite having a viable NFL frame, Reed hasn't been able to show enough on tape to earn a plus grade for any of the critical or secondary traits teams are looking for from a defensive end. However, his improvement during his senior season could give teams enough hope to take a shot.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cedric-reed/32005245-4515-9531-3c90-c2a0fbc5b754
Jordan Richards,"A limited, run-support safety whose coverage issues could be an issue for NFL teams looking for diverse safety play. He's a willing tackler who plays with range in run support, but Richards' lack of instincts and ability to stick receivers in space could limit his NFL opportunities.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-richards/32005249-4329-3560-5473-cde35c9f99d5
Corey Robinson,"Hulking tackle, but needs to do more with it. Doesn't have the kick-slide to consistently get out to meet speed off the edge, and when faced with inside moves, he struggles to move feet and secure the gap. Foot quickness could benefit if he trimmed down, but a move inside could be considered if teams feel like he can play with enough bend.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-robinson/3200524f-4238-4465-4125-cdb9f49d7ef7
Jake Ryan,"He's got the size, physicality and commitment to film work to play inside, but his instincts still need work. Ryan is a little stiff and stays blocked for too long, but his disengagement from blocks will improve with more reps inside. Faster than quick, he is scheme versatile and can fit inside or at the SAM linebacker spot in a 4-3. Ryan's productivity comes from toughness, play demeanor and physical tools. Teams could pigeonhole him as a ""try-hard"" linebacker, but they shouldn't.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-ryan/32005259-4120-8916-5cde-ca80c981ce42
Austin Shepherd,He can mirror in pass protection and takes good angles that help him get to his zone-blocking responsibilities. He's a worker bee who can use technique and effort to win more snaps than he should against more talented players. He can be an NFL backup with the potential to become a starter.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-shepherd/32005348-4549-6306-6bdd-c62acf51fda8
Jean Sifrin,"Raw but athletic tight end with above-average leaping ability and open-field talent to stress defenses vertically. While he played in-line and standing, he looked much more comfortable as a stand-up tight end. Sifrin could improve rapidly with a committed approach and NFL coaching, but he has a very limited career window due to his age, which could push him way down on some draft boards.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jean-sifrin/32005349-4656-3610-da36-a950cf398c93
Donovan Smith,"The frame of a guard and the skill set of a guard probably means Smith will end up moving to guard. His hands need work, but with power as his calling card and the ability to hide some of his athletic deficiencies by moving him inside, he has a good shot of getting drafted and fighting for a backup spot.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donovan-smith/3200534d-4922-1725-3f1e-39d251c81444
Martrell Spaight,"Spaight played two years of JUCO football and started just two games as a junior at Arkansas. This past season was his first as a full-time starter and he is still learning the nuances of the position. He's physical and productive between the tackles, but might be limited when asked to make plays on the perimeter.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/martrell-spaight/32005350-4120-2019-c85a-8a10ebdc7c00
Damian Swann,"Gangly cornerback with spindly legs but a willingness to play physically and with great energy and effort. Swann doesn't play tightly enough in coverage or make enough plays on the ball to be a starting cornerback and doesn't have the size to transition to safety full time, but he's versatile and highly competitive and has a legitimate shot to make a team.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damian-swann/32005357-4131-4232-f9c1-b9c2e8010870
Louis Trinca-Pasat,"Trinca-Pasat is a three-year starter who saw his productivity take a big jump his senior season thanks to a more aggressive scheme and consistency of effort. His play traits are worthy of draft consideration, but his lack of size will be something that will have to be countered with scheme. He works inside the construct of a defensive scheme exceptionally well and defensive coaches will love his hustle.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/louis-trinca-pasat/32005452-4924-5190-c5ce-15daa90b1b50
Davis Tull,"Tull uses smarts, skill and toughness to dominate his level of competition. Tull has the athleticism to play outside linebacker in an odd front and his relentless nature and ability to outplay expectations could make him an NFL surprise.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davis-tull/32005455-4c13-6073-d952-32ff69884f46
C.J. Uzomah,Former high school wide receiver who still plays the game with a wide receiver's mindset rather than a tight end's. Must get tougher and more physical to become a serviceable in-line blocker but that might not happen. Underutilized in Auburn's limited passing game and could become a much more productive move tight end in the pros than he was in college.,5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c-j-uzomah/3200555a-4f41-5291-7c48-f42f95ee20d2
Trey Williams,"All-purpose running back with an ability to hit big plays from time to time, but no value as an every-down player. Some teams might view Williams as a luxury talent with minimal value due to his lack of size and natural position fit, while other teams will see him as a chess piece that they can deploy to create mismatches and use to stress defenses. His kick-return ability adds value, but there's likely a ceiling on just how highly he will be drafted.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-williams/32005749-4c54-7628-3cf7-a83c4aefffec
Karlos Williams,"Williams is a big, talented athlete who is still finding his way as a running back. He seemed almost content to lose his job in 2014 and teams will be turning over every rock looking for information on his character. As a one-cut runner with exceptional burst and rare physical traits, Williams could become a very good starter in a zone-based scheme, but his floor is very low based on character and scheme fit.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/karlos-williams/32005749-4c39-8250-3203-7c4584bc633d
Zach Zenner,"When evaluators look at small-school prospects, they want to see them dominate that level of competition and that is exactly what Zenner was able to do. Zenner is more fast than sudden and might be best-suited in a one-cut scheme. His production, size and speed will generate plenty of discussion in draft meetings.",5.8,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-zenner/32005a45-4e51-3046-77e5-57166e5fc8d7
Deion Barnes,"Base end in college who might lack the natural pass-rushing ability or strength at the point of attack to play defensive end in the NFL. Barnes appears to have enough athleticism to transition to 3-4 outside linebacker, but he must improve his hand usage and become more skilled as a pass rusher to fit into a 3-4 role.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deion-barnes/32004241-5227-0183-2b6d-9fa3a2b7b6e2
Ben Beckwith,Phone-booth fighter with scheme limitations. Has strength to handle himself in a power-based scheme and is technically sound in pass protection. Ability to play center and guard gives him a decent shot of making an NFL roster.,5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-beckwith/32004245-4379-9583-6a71-045f08434d9e
Blake Bell,"A newly converted tight end who was a short-yardage specialist and red-zone brute for the Sooners as a quarterback. Bell was looked over by scouting community during the regular season, but he has flashed sure hands and shown improvement as a blocker and could have an NFL future if a team is willing to be patient with him.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/blake-bell/32004245-4c22-7990-64c5-8c2ffa5bd463
Bernard Blake,Angular cornerback with easy moving hips and feet to mirror and match off the line of scrimmage. He's not big enough to press and could get mismatched by size or rushing attacks if moved to the slot. Has the traits to make an NFL roster as a backup.,5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bernard-blake/3200424c-4157-3836-67b0-be3a03beda7c
Cariel Brooks,"Competitive and aggressive sub-package corner with man-cover skills and a willingness to do what is necessary to stay on the field. His size likely puts a ceiling on his draft stock, but the tape should have teams giving him a draftable grade.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cariel-brooks/32004252-4f11-9059-fee0-b7eaad4837be
Shane Carden,"Has NFL size and NFL intangibles but might not possess the necessary physical traits to project into a starter's role in the NFL. His competitiveness, intelligence and production will matter more to teams that are less reliant on traits-based quarterbacks. Might be looking at a career as a quality backup.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shane-carden/32004341-5204-7283-76d4-3d5e7fa279d0
Anthony Chickillo,"Technically sound player who lacks the desired burst and pass-rush skills to be a full-time defensive end and needs more bulk to play inside. Chickillo could use more length, but with his arm extension and strength at the point of attack, he could find his way as a backup strong-side defensive end in a 4-3.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-chickillo/32004348-4921-8488-d568-47df0a4a31b4
DaVaris Daniels,"Daniels suspension and then dismissal over academic dishonesty will need to be looked into, but the tape shows a receiver who is still learning to run better routes and maximize his size. Daniels lacks plus athleticism or speed and missing an entire year of football puts him behind in his wide receiver studies. His production and size could get him a look but he will likely need time to sharpen his skills as a receiver before he is ready to contribute.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davaris-daniels/32004441-4e52-9377-29b6-80ad644239d1
Devante Davis,"Davis does his best work after the throw is in the air, with terrific awareness and body control. His problem is that he doesn't do anything special before the throw to get open. He doesn't have the feet or acceleration to free himself, so he will have to learn to body up defenders more effectively and become special with his hands in order to be an NFL backup.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devante-davis/32004441-5626-3423-91d9-1a87c22ad4bb
Xzavier Dickson,"Used as a 3-4 outside backer at times and as a defensive end when Alabama goes to it's even front, Dickson has adequate skills as a pass rusher, but is average to below average against the run. Dickson doesn't feature the explosive, athletic traits to be a pass rushing specialist and might not have enough strength at the point of attack to be an every down defensive end.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xzavier-dickson/32004449-4373-6160-d300-358d8ea488a1
Miles Dieffenbach,"If he can get back to his level of play from 2013, then he is a draftable player who has movement and power traits that give him a chance to earn playing time in the NFL. Dieffenbach's 2014 tape will scare many teams and his medicals will be closely scrutinized, but his recovery and potential might be worth a late-round pick.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/miles-dieffenbach/32004449-4503-8875-64c8-5b0838daee20
B.J. Dubose,"Has the lower body of a defensive end, but lacks the talent and athleticism to make that his home. Has enough strength at the point of attack to be a 3-4 defensive end but is unlikely to be a plus play against the run or pass from that position.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/b-j-dubose/32004455-4254-6222-e628-67130730361c
Durell Eskridge,"Tall safety with average instincts and average speed to chase throws over the top and range from hash to sideline. Eskridge plays with enough desire as a tackler to warrant a draft pick, but he‚Äôs got to prove that he has a bankable skill in the box or in coverage to go along with his size.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/durell-eskridge/32004553-4b55-8735-fc93-486be63285bf
Clayton Geathers,"Active, physical safety with short-area coverage ability and a willingness to get his hands dirty near the line of scrimmage. Geathers has the talent to play in the league but he makes too many mistakes to be trusted just yet and might need a year or two of seasoning and development.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clayton-geathers/32004745-4140-5166-c149-89a3a66bff99
Obum Gwacham,Explosive athlete with only one year of experience at defensive end after transitioning from wide receiver. Gwacham lacks the functional strength to play the run and he's still in the infant stages of learning how to rush the passer. His desire and character combined with his superb physical traits could make him a late-round project who teams show patience with as he gets bigger and continues to learn the position.,5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/obum-gwacham/32004757-4111-8654-3ed5-6152cfa7b8e9
Chris Hackett,"Hackett has limited speed and is thinner than desired for the position. He has some holes in coverage and isn't going to come up and thump as a run supporter, but there are some personnel men that think highly of him as a potential playmaker at the next level.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-hackett/32004841-4349-4322-4dde-6affa89bfb9a
Rannell Hall,"Isn't going to get teams excited with his size, play speed or hands, but he's willing to do whatever is asked of him and flashes enough potential to be viewed as a developmental prospect.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rannell-hall/32004841-4c47-7156-163f-408800fc1a40
Connor Halliday,"Lanky ""system quarterback"" lacking a strong arm and an ability to create plays outside of the pocket. Halliday shows an adequate level of football intelligence and has enough accuracy to warrant a draft pick. One positive is that he has clearly improved over the last two seasons and might continue on the same track once he works into an NFL system. A role as a backup might be his ceiling.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/connor-halliday/32004841-4c64-1981-f9a5-0bd2d146f862
Chad Hamilton,"Outstanding athlete who dominated the competition on the FCS level with athleticism and sound technique. Hamilton's lack of length could force him inside and once there, he must prove he's strong enough to handle himself. His athleticism and steady technical work might put him ahead of the curve as far as zone-running teams are concerned and his best position could well be center if he's able to snap it.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chad-hamilton/32004841-4d19-5845-7338-8fa4e76d952e
Bobby Hart,"Young, soft-bodied prospect who is best suited to play guard in the NFL. Tape doesn't always treat Hart kindly, but his issues in pass protection as a tackle won't be same issues he faces in the NFL as a guard. While he has physical limitations, Hart is a competitive player who flashes NFL power potential.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bobby-hart/32004841-5265-9972-2dde-0391002e0586
Taylor Heinicke,"Heinicke has the ball placement and accuracy of an NFL backup when he's protected and dealing, but his small stature combined with his inability to drive the ball and make NFL throws could be hard to overcome once he gets into an NFL camp. Heinicke must play in a timing-based system to have a chance of being on an NFL roster.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taylor-heinicke/32004845-4961-0185-afff-3aef55a8ec24
Amarlo Herrera,"Undersized inside linebacker who doesn't use his instincts to play a downhill, attack-oriented brand of football. Herrera has a nose for the ball and a motor that keeps him in most plays, but he lacks the bulk to carry through with his desire to play physically and too much of his tackle production comes down the field. He is best-suited as a backup inside linebacker with an ability to play on kick-coverage teams.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/amarlo-herrera/32004845-5246-8073-dd49-26e08dd11a05
Sean Hickey,"High-cut college tackle who could struggle badly in pass protection if left at that position in the pros. If he were a little more athletic, he could be an interesting center prospect in the Chris Myers mold. As an NFL prospect, he won't check off many of the boxes teams are looking for in terms of his natural talent.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-hickey/32004849-4311-5357-eea9-18ebfc846efd
Zack Hodges,"The change of direction and edge-bending potential are both there, but Hodges is still very raw and lacks the functional strength to set the edge as a 3-4 outside 'backer. He appears to be a project who must live in the weight room in order to be able to become a more complete physical talent.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zack-hodges/3200484f-4449-5185-1881-a09cd1a704dd
Jesse James,"Big, in-line tight end with room on his frame for more muscle, but he's limited by a lack of functional athleticism and a mechanical play demeanor. James isn't a plus receiver with great hands and he lacks the quickness to consistently free himself from man coverage, so he must become a more determined run blocker in order to have a shot at starting in the NFL.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jesse-james/32004a41-4d23-9797-c82d-bde8548b3188
Kyshoen Jarrett,"Productive, yet limited, three-year starter with a nose for the ball and a willingness to play a physical brand of football. He can be a liability in coverage and will have to be covered up by scheme, but he's an absolute bulldog around the line of scrimmage and can play on special teams right away.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyshoen-jarrett/32004a41-5225-9599-3605-2ca7b07c5cb1
B.J. Larsen,"Called a ""self-made man"" and ""tremendously tough"" by his head coach. Rarely gives the opposing offensive lineman a snap off, but his game is based on good hand work and raw effort rather than athleticism and raw talent. If Larsen can add more weight, he might be able to become a rotational defensive end in a 3-4 defense.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/b-j-larsen/32004c41-5238-6135-3c53-43b0b26e65fe
Deon Long,"An ""X"" receiver in college who will likely be forced into the slot based on lack of desired size and speed.

Terrence Magee,"Limited, dime-a-dozen running back who will get some attention from teams for his willingness to stick his nose into blitzers and protect the quarterback on third downs. Has just three kickoff returns over last two seasons, so he's likely a camp body who must find a way to shine with limited reps.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terrence-magee/32004d41-4726-3157-ee9f-fcc0442298b1
Ronald Martin,Loves football and brings physicality and competitiveness to each snap. Limited in coverage and as a functional athlete. His best bet is to make it as a situational sub and core special-teamer.,5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronald-martin/32004d41-5270-6350-9404-dd1468f2dc71
Joey Mbu,"Mbu will outwork many of the defensive tackles in this draft, but the question is whether his effort level can make up for his inability to dominate against the run or as a pass rusher. Mbu's football character and size give him a shot to make an NFL team.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joey-mbu/32004d42-5502-9662-5d69-eef31fa86144
Tevin McDonald,"The instincts, confidence and competitiveness are all there, but his coverage skills need major work and his lack of size could preclude him from making a living near the line of scrimmage. He has the mental makeup, but comes up a little short on the physical side. His desire and instincts give him a shot to make a roster, but he needs to add more bulk.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tevin-mcdonald/32004d43-4455-2545-2821-b185d08bbf3f
Darrian Miller,"He doesn't have the length or athleticism to make it as an NFL tackle, so he he'll likely have to make the switch to guard. Has smarts and hands to play guard or center, but his lower body power must improve. With coaching, Miller could be a serviceable interior backup.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrian-miller/32004d49-4c20-9686-e2a0-33eed230dd3b
Mitch Morse,"Morse relies on timing, instincts and angles to get guys blocked as a tackle on the college level but might lack the arm length and functional athleticism to play tackle in the pros. If he moves inside to guard, his toughness will serve him well, but he's not a power player and must prove that he can sustain his block and positioning to be an effective run blocker.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mitch-morse/32004d4f-5273-4298-bd04-8d9888d3a0cd
Deiontrez Mount,"Competes and plays with toughness and above-average play strength for his size, but needs more bulk to play defensive end.

Levi Norwood,"After a couple of productive college seasons, Norwood saw his playing time and production slashed in 2014 due to competition at the position. While he has the hands and the toughness, scouts believe he is a limited receiver who needs a good workout to get back on draft radars.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/levi-norwood/32004e4f-5278-4683-3b1e-b8d817e0634a
Rakeem Nunez-Roches,"Fireplug with a good motor and an ability to find gaps and drive upfield through them. He's missing the size and brute strength necessary to consistently handle himself in phone booth battle so he will have to play in a one-gap, upfield defense. He has the look of a penetrating nose who will have to start his career as a backup.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rakeem-nunez-roches/32004e55-4e25-0521-92d6-3fde26feb3fc
Mark Nzeocha,"Nzeocha has a tremendous amount of athleticism and speed, but his instincts for the game must be developed and sharpened before he can be trusted as a full-time starter. His potential and ceiling are exciting (provided he recovers from injury), but he's the textbook definition of project. Like the Eagles' Bryan Braman, he has the length and speed to become a highly effective special-teams player.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mark-nzeocha/32004e5a-4547-4619-c3fe-e387a0f7a11a
Damian Parms,"Aggressive box safety with adequate ability in man coverage underneath. However, he could struggle if asked to cover downfield. Parms charges downhill -- he will race to the action against the run and is a reliable tackler. He's almost too disciplined in his approach and doesn't have the instincts or willingness to cheat in coverage to create more opportunities for plays on the ball.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damian-parms/32005041-5260-9316-8a65-44f318dc8ee6
Travis Raciti,"Raciti had a big sophomore season but struggled when he was shifted to a 3-4 defense as a junior. In 2014, Raciti moved back to a 4-3 and attacked upfield again. Raciti has to go up or down in weight because he's not big enough to survive at the point of attack on the inside. Some evaluators see value in Raciti slimming down and bouncing outside to a 3-4 strong-side linebacker spot.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-raciti/32005241-4329-0361-2c32-ca6b094e75ae
Jermauria Rasco,"Rasco doesn't have the pass-rush talent to draw a great deal of excitement leading up to the draft, but he keeps his eyes glued to the backfield and he is rarely out of position. Rasco can use his toughness, football acumen and quickness to compete for a spot with a blitz-happy, complex defense as a 3-4 OLB.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jermauria-rasco/32005241-5309-6558-82df-56a58aadd567
Josh Robinson,Compact running back with squatty lower body and a short-striding style that allows him to get to his top speed quickly in the open field. Robinson appears to be lacking an NFL burst and the shiftiness needed to create more yardage for himself on the second level. He has good short-area footwork and is effective as a pass-catcher but is lacking a differentiating talent from the rest of the backs in this draft.,5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-robinson/3200524f-4259-0769-ff79-05ec4b6720ae
Spencer Roth,"Decorated four-year punter with outstanding size, and consistent accuracy and touch when needed.

James Sample,"Physical box safety with good meat on the bones and a willingness to play physical football. Sample is stymied by his lack of football experience which plays into his lack of instincts and coverage talent at his position. Sample shows good play speed and ability to range, but needs more time to develop into a more complete player.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-sample/32005341-4d11-7282-7a90-d2f325e737de
Wes Saxton,"Saxton has traits that have opened the eyes of some scouts. He can run and has the length and hands of an NFL tight end. His biggest draft obstacle is that his willingness and/or ability to compete as a run blocker limits his value to a team. Saxton needs to get bigger and show a greater commitment to improving all facets of his game. For now, he is a developmental prospect with athletic traits.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/wes-saxton/32005341-5864-5435-a780-ae68edae4772
Blake Sims,"An undersized, move quarterback who can make plays outside of the pocket. Has enough arm to threaten defenses over the top.

A.J. Tarpley,"Heady inside linebacker mindful of assignments in scheme-oriented Stanford defense. Nothing special about his size, athleticism or competitiveness on tape and lack of downhill metrics could limit his draft prospects despite his steady play.

Jordan Taylor,"Taylor is a productive, outside-the-numbers vertical threat with an ability to sting a defense after the catch. Needs work, but is a plus athlete with great height and an ability to separate. Must prove he can get off press coverage and play stronger in order to become viable NFL receiver.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-taylor/32005441-5943-9186-13c1-73ca14e28ecd
Cam Thomas,"Long, angular cornerback with a willingness to tackle and an understanding of how to play the game, but his lack of functional speed could doom him at cornerback in the NFL. If he can fill out his thin frame with more muscle, he might have a shot at transitioning to safety, but his body type doesn't look ready for that move just yet.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-thomas/32005448-4f06-3714-dd1c-c15135072670
Lynden Trail,"Teams will be forced to draft Trail on projection rather than tape. While his production looks good on paper, Trail never stands out as a dominant force. He failed to flash at the Senior Bowl as a defensive player but took some reps near the goal line as a tight end, which could be his best chance to make a team and stick in the league.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lynden-trail/32005452-4121-4132-9805-536761f8bcc1
Tyler Varga,"Could get pushed into the fullback genre when, in reality, he's a running back and an instinctive one at that. Varga's ability to run and catch gives him a shot at the back end of a depth chart, but he might have to show he can take snaps as a move fullback and shine on special teams to make an NFL team.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-varga/32005641-5230-6732-8a0b-318e24f073d7
Brandon Vitabile,"Vitabile has shorter than desired arm length for an NFL frame. His lack of length could hurt his ability to  sustain blocks and get into nose tackles first. Run blocking could be a series of stalemates for him, but he has balance and anchor to be capable pass blocker and should compete for a roster spot.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-vitabile/32005649-5426-3361-8df1-f0668d44db5a
DeAndrew White,"High school speedster who appears to have lost a step since his 2012 knee injury, but who is still quick enough and athletic enough to find the open spaces and make yards after the catch. While his injury history could very well be a draft deterrent, White's talent should get him a look and give him a shot to make a team. He might have to return kicks to prove his worth early on.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deandrew-white/32005748-4915-2624-26c3-e9625de98423
Xavier Williams,"High-cut developmental prospect at defensive tackle who plays with the motor and toughness that teams will love, but he is still in need of more seasoning and growth.

Damien Wilson,"Fills the stat sheet, but is missing traits associated with becoming a starting linebacker in the NFL. He is an average athlete with average speed and loses leverage in his run responsibilities. He's a willing chaser and he's around the action, so a move to the WILL outside 'backer spot might make the most sense in order to limit his liability against downhill rushing attacks.",5.6,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damien-wilson/32005749-4c66-4778-a2c9-a44b815d6e0e
David Andrews,"Andrews is a three-year starter and a quality football player. He's a consistent performer who will have to find a fit with a zone scheme rushing attack because of his lack of NFL mass and power. Andrews has enough skill to play in the league, but his small frame will be a non-starter for some teams.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-andrews/3200414e-4465-2945-5c46-ad9c6f0fca0d
E.J. Bibbs,"Bibbs flashed some productivity with the Cyclones over the last two seasons, but he is a below-average athlete without eye-catching potential as a run blocker. Bibbs will have to prove he can be a viable NFL blocker to make it as a tight end and he might end up getting a look as a fullback.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/e-j-bibbs/32004249-4207-4624-db8e-5daae126e22f
Angelo Blackson,"Space-eater who can eat blocks up but won't spit out much production. Is a liability as a pass rusher and might need to add more mass to lock in as a pure, two-gap nose who can help to keep linebackers clean.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/angelo-blackson/3200424c-4132-6665-cd8f-3d01d2e24bcf
Al Bond,"A mauler who will have to kick down from right tackle to guard due to his lack of functional athleticism in pass protection. His struggles with changing direction and handling active defenders and twists will still be a problem inside. Bond is unable to block in space, so he will likely be confined to competing for a spot on a power-run-only team.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/al-bond/3200424f-4e09-0600-8e25-be2ad6b87da6
Leon Brown,"Brown has experience at both tackle and guard, but he'll be limited to playing guard in the NFL. Brown doesn't show much potential to be a block-winner as a pro, but he has enough size and ability to get into a camp and compete for a backup spot.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leon-brown/32004252-4f54-5277-d229-cf59fd317e0c
Kaelin Clay,"Slot receiver lacking suddenness to get open against man coverage underneath, but with a second gear to find separation on deep throws. Clay's size and playmaking ability as a receiver aren‚Äôt going to do much for most teams, but his return ability gives him a shot at making a team.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kaelin-clay/3200434c-4172-6206-5f5e-4bc84f2b963b
Dillon Day,"It isn't easy to maintain a starting position for four years in the SEC unless a player is competitive and tough. Day's competitive nature, toughness and football intelligence give him a shot, but his lack of athleticism could make it difficult for him to finish assignments consistently as a pro.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dillon-day/32004441-5919-2812-7a92-404ad0050ae9
Ryan Delaire,"Delaire could add weight and look to become a base end in a 4-3, but he flashed the athleticism and strength to warrant a look as an edge-setting 3-4 outside linebacker with explorable traits as a pass rusher. His NFL Scouting Combine and personal workouts might determine whether or not he is drafted.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-delaire/32004445-4c05-3090-aab2-902e6cd587d1
Trey DePriest,"Burly and thick through his middle, DePriest needs plays to unfold in front of him to play at his best. With offenses becoming matchup-oriented, DePriest's value to an NFL team could be diminished. Best-suited as a two-down ILB in a 3-4 defense.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-depriest/32004445-5073-6508-c3d3-ca86c15562cf
Jahwan Edwards,"Edwards has the size to be an NFL back and he was a consistent producer within his conference, but his marginal play speed and tendency to drift towards the line of scrimmage could cause him to get captured more quickly than desired for a starting running back. He has the traits to be a backup, but must show special teams ability and improved pass protection.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jahwan-edwards/32004544-5751-3954-3b0f-60c83b10866b
Cody Fajardo,"Productive run-pass quarterback who was forced to carry a substantial percentage of the offensive success on his shoulders. His confidence and accuracy dipped in 2014 and he lacks the poise and arm to become a starter in the league. He's a willing learner and has a chance to be a third quarterback with ""package"" potential thanks to his toughness as a runner.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-fajardo/32004641-4a05-9326-3c0d-d34a0a59ff6d
Jalston Fowler,"Fowler plays a dying position and doesn't offer elite blocking downhill or on the move. His ability to catch the ball and be a core special-teams player makes him a viable contender for a roster spot, even though it might be as an undrafted free agent.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalston-fowler/3200464f-5744-2542-c456-81862ad0a221
Chaz Green,"Heady player with potential position versatility, but lacking an area where he truly excels. His foot quickness and movement skill will appeal to zone-scheme teams but he must improve his strength and ability in pass protection if he wants to be anything more than a backup.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chaz-green/32004752-4511-8131-4469-c2982a36fb6a
Bryce Hager,"With his burst to the ball and ability to cover, Hager would be best suited for a 4-3 defense looking for an athletic linebacker who can make plays outside of his area. Hager might end up a late-round pick, but teams like his production and chase traits.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-hager/32004841-4735-2499-5531-a02e956014e9
Pete Hart,"Undersized runner with a big back's fearlessness. Hart is a gritty, determined player who fought his way back from two injuries to the same knee and a lack of playing time at Alabama before transferring. He was highly productive in his one year at Colorado State, but could have a hard time making a roster due to his lack of size and pro-caliber quickness.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/pete-hart/32004841-5266-2662-c92c-3f4bdae1a7ae
Martin Ifedi,"His lack of athleticism and skill as a pass rusher could hurt his draft stock, but Ifedi has the strength and toughness to be considered as a left end with run-stopping potential in a 4-3 defense.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/martin-ifedi/32004946-4514-8317-74b0-11156e0ebc4d
Darius Kilgo,"Kilgo's frame carries his weight well, but he's missing the power necessary to play the nose. Kilgo rarely threatens the gap as a penetrator and he struggles to hold up against double teams. Kilgo's lack of aggressive temperament and pure strength could make him a tough sell on draft day.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darius-kilgo/32004b49-4c21-1314-d2eb-37f2f9474359
Khari Lee,"Very good athlete whose background as a basketball player is obvious in his body control and positioning.

Cole Manhart,"Decorated Division II tackle prospect who might have to move to center to have any shot in the NFL. As an NFL guard, Manhart would be athletic enough for a zone scheme, but NFL scouts have grave concerns about his ability to drop anchor and handle power from the inside. Manhart could be a late-round target or priority free agent with practice-squad potential as a center.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cole-manhart/32004d41-4e28-5063-7b53-7775efd52130
Ellis McCarthy,"Came into UCLA as a heralded five-star recruit and is leaving school after three seasons with just eight starts including none this past season. McCarthy has size that will plant him on some draft boards, but he lacks skill as a pass rusher and hasn't proved that he can venture from a phone booth to make plays. McCarthy's knees will need to be checked closely, but the bigger concern could be his weight problems and whether or not he has the desire to do what it takes to be a player in the league.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ellis-mccarthy/32004d43-4318-4267-2d82-c606ab99367b
Casey Pierce,"Can line up in a variety of spots. Offers formation versatility and a willingness to do the dirty work as a blocker. He won't do much on the ground after the catch, but he has reliable hands and the competitive temperament to give himself a legitimate shot of making a roster, likely for a West Coast offense.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/casey-pierce/32005049-4522-5306-c3d0-187d5cb0e4c0
MyCole Pruitt,"The production is impressive. It warrants attention and accolades, but the tape shows an alarming inconsistency of effort and competitive fire. Pruitt won't be considered a plus athlete for the position by NFL standards, so he must crank up the motor and keep it running -- especially when asked to block since that might be his way onto a team.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mycole-pruitt/32005052-5572-0361-2ad1-b85baa0ceec4
Curtis Riley,He's a man-cover cornerback with willingness to tackle and below-average instincts and awareness. Riley lacks the twitch to recover when beaten and his instincts aren't good enough to put him into position to make plays on the ball. Needs more film study and will likely need time on a practice squad to have a shot.,5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/curtis-riley/32005249-4c12-3071-f43d-2e8fd43b2206
Ryan Russell,"Russell will frustrate NFL teams because he has many of the physical traits they covet, but he doesn't do enough with them.

Ross Scheuerman,"Difficult projection due to running-lane limitations with below-average blocking in front of him. Appears to have decent top-end speed to go with legitimate twitch and could get a look as a slot receiver, similar to the move the Patriots' Julian Edelman made out of Kent State.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ross-scheuerman/32005343-4813-9023-c143-42d29600f411
Tony Washington,"Washington's lower body could use more bulk, but as a 3-4 OLB, he has enough play strength. He's technically proficient against the run on the edge and should continue to improve as a pass rusher with more work in that area during camps. Washington lacks dynamic qualities against the run or pass, but should be able to get into a camp.",5.5,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tony-washington/32005741-5377-8332-6d61-7b3f939dbeee
Neiron Ball,"Versatile linebacker with good play speed and a motor that teams look for. While Ball's play clearly improved from 2013 to 2014, his physical issues will be tough to overcome by draft day. He overcame losing both of his parents before the age of 10 as well as brain surgery in 2011, so he's no stranger to adversity and perseverance. Ball might have to attempt to beat the odds once again and make a roster via the undrafted-free-agent route.",5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/neiron-ball/32004241-4c57-3596-4758-8105dc3766eb
Tavaris Barnes,"Possesses the size and raw athleticism to warrant a look and the tape suggests that he could open some eyes with quickness and explosion numbers. Barnes doesn't play like an instinctual end at this time, but the traits are intriguing even though he appears to be a project at this point.",5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tavaris-barnes/32004241-5237-8720-a684-3d4359064e90

Dominique Brown,"Big back who doesn't usually run like it and rarely imposes his will on second-level tacklers. Content to do just enough to get by, according to key evaluators in the league, and his loss of playing time was about effort and work ethic, which isn't going to sit well with NFL teams. Brown's size gives him a shot, but he doesn't have the creativity as a runner to make it if power isn't his calling card in the NFL.",5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dominique-brown/32004252-4f39-5301-8d54-e7c70a7c1013

Takoby Cofield,Phone-booth run blocker who shows an understanding of angles and footwork to overcome his slow feet and get to the edge against speed. Cofield lacks the athleticism and anchor that NFL teams are looking for from a starting offensive lineman and Cofield's ceiling might be as an NFL backup on the right side.,5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/takoby-cofield/3200434f-4676-1442-5008-939f108bb2bb
Justin Cox,"Cox used his speed to dominate at the JUCO level, but he wasn't able to post the same level of production while at Mississippi State. Cox doesn't show much anticipation in the run or passing games and doesn't have the frame or functional level of physicality teams look for from their safeties. While he is expected to post some big numbers at the combine, the tape isn't as kind to him.",5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-cox/3200434f-5844-0040-252b-a2cdbb317358
Corey Crawford,"Has the look of an NFL starter until the tape starts running.

Zach D'Orazio,"Has great size working from the slot, but doesn't show enough speed or separation ability to inspire enough confidence that he will get selected on size alone. His hands look like they are NFL-ready until the tape reveals his noticeable struggles to secure the low throw. He's a possession receiver who can make some things happen against zone coverage, but he's limited beyond that.",5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-d-orazio/3200444f-5211-5801-db5d-345f2b9afe32
Michael Dyer,"Productive college runner who gives a good, honest effort each time out, but he's dependent upon scheme and strong blocking to help him get yardage. Dyer lacks the athleticism and speed to be an explosive NFL threat and, with very little on his resume as a pass-catcher, making a roster could be a challenge.",5.4,2015,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-dyer/32004459-4563-1435-3a0d-e46df305fb15
Curtis Grant,"Looks the part, but has limitations in terms of instincts and overall nose for the ball. He's a physical inside linebacker with pass-rush and pass-coverage limitations.

Greg Henderson,"Smallish with a thin build, Henderson was more productive and confident as a junior. Teams will be less concerned with his lack of play strength than they will with his lack of ball skills and overall instincts.

Anthony Jefferson,"Tight-hipped, straight line cornerback-turned-safety who has a nose for getting in on tackles, but who lacks the athleticism and cover skills teams will be looking for from starting safeties.

Gus Johnson,"Compact running back with power in his lower body to break tackles and extend runs, but he's not a chain-moving power runner with a desire to punish tacklers.

Nigel King,Outside receiver who lacks the athleticism and route sharpness to be anything more than a vertical receiver who tries to win with size and ball skills down the field.

Dean Marlowe,An athletically limited safety with the demeanor to play near the line of scrimmage but currently lacks the bulk to do so consistently as a tackler.

Shaquille Riddick,Riddick played out of position as a five-technique in West Virginia's defense and was simply not big enough for the position.

Myles Jack,"One of the most versatile players in college football the past three seasons, Jack earned a reputation as a dynamic defender and a contributor on offense. In fact, he earned both the Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year award in 2013, as well as being named finalist for Paul Hornung Award as the nation‚Äôs most versatile player.  A second-team All-Pac 12 defender as a freshman (75 tackles, two interception, 11 passes defended), he had seven rushing touchdowns on the year as well. Pac-12 coaches voted him second team all-conference again in 2014, as he made 88 tackles, eight for loss, intercepted one pass and broke up seven others. He also contributed as a runner, as well, carrying the rock 28 times for 113 yards and three scores. Jack‚Äôs junior year was stopped short by a knee injury three games in, though he looked like he was on the way to a fantastic season before the malady occurred (15 tackles, interception). Despite the injury, Jack announced he had ""done enough"" at UCLA and wanted to be compensated for his play -- so he declared for early entry in the 2016 NFL Draft. Considering that his mother insured Jack against injury after his freshman season, it's not surprising that economics won the day in Jack's decision.",7.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/myles-jack/32004a41-4300-8463-68da-a616650bb95d
Laremy Tunsil,"The 2015 season was difficult for Tunsil. First, he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in Ole Miss' loss to TCU in the 2014 Peach Bowl. Tunsil then was charged with domestic assault against his stepfather in June, reportedly for sticking up for his mother. Those charges were eventually dismissed, but then the NCAA brought another piece of bad news soon after, suspending Tunsil for seven games due to impermissible benefits he received (vehicle loans without payment, free airline ticket and rental car) and failing to be forthcoming with investigators. When he was on the field, though, Tunsil lived up to his billing as the No. 1 high school recruit at offensive tackle. He started nine games at left tackle as a true freshman, earning second-team All-SEC notice from league media and various Freshman All-American honors. Tunsil missed two games with a partially torn bicep in 2014, but started the rest, garnering first-team All-SEC nod from the Associated Press (second team from coaches) and All-American recognition from multiple media outlets. He didn‚Äôt make many post-season all-conference lists in his shortened junior season (starting six games at left tackle), but finished his career in a way most offensive linemen can only dream of -- running in a two-yard touchdown on a throw-back pass behind the line of scrimmage in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma State.",7.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/laremy-tunsil/32005455-4e56-5442-704e-acb84ae7be26
DeForest Buckner,"It would be foolish for team to be wary of selecting Buckner because of the lack of success of former Ducks defender and number three overall pick Dion Jordan, as he's a completely different type of player. The 2015 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, Ted Hendricks Award finalist and member of multiple All-American squads (first team USA Today, second team AP, etc.) presents a thicker frame, portending an NFL career with his hand on the ground, rather than a stand-up pass rusher like Jordan. Buckner had become a name to note as a 2014 second-team All-Pac-12 pick (led team with 13 tackles for loss) after two seasons as a partial-year starter; he had 29 tackles and two starts, playing in every game as a true freshman in 2013, followed by a eight-start sophomore season (3.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks). He finished off his career in style (83 tackles, 17 for loss, Pac-12 leading 10.5 sacks), putting himself among the top prospects in the senior class.",7.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deforest-buckner/32004255-4376-8760-299c-0fb49b4a62d2
Ezekiel Elliott,"Elliott's dad, Stacy, played linebacker for the Missouri Tigers and was on the unfortunate end of the infamous ""fifth down"" play in which Colorado scored a game-winning touchdown (which might not have crossed the goal line) after officials in charge of the down markers failed to mark a play. ""Zeke"" has had much more success than heartbreak during his athletic career, however. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch High School Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, Elliott also had the speed to win four state titles in track and field (100 meters, 200 meters, 110 high hurdles, and 300 hurdles).  He contributed as a reserve in his freshman year in Columbus (30-262, two TD rushing) before hitting it big in 2014, finishing with three straight 200-yard games, including two against Alabama which (scoring six times in those two contests) helped the Buckeyes win the national title. Elliott carried forth the momentum from the end of his honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore year into 2015, when he received the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year award (1,821 yards, 23 TD rushing; 27-206 receiving) and second-team All-American notice from the Associated Press and USA Today. Unfortunately, Ohio State's home loss to Michigan State on a terrible weather day, in which Elliott received only 15 carries (complaining to the media afterwards about his lack of totes), prevented the team from defending its title in the College Football Playoff. His 149-yard, four touchdown effort against Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl put a happy ending on his career, however, allowing him to finish second all-time in rushing yards for the storied Buckeyes program.",7.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ezekiel-elliott/3200454c-4c28-9284-cdcc-74694c8d1749
Jaylon Smith,"Heading into the Fiesta Bowl, Smith was considered one of the best defenders in the country and a sure-fire elite prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft. He tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee during the team‚Äôs loss to Ohio State, however, placing some doubt on whether he would apply for early entry. The 2015 consensus All-American decided he had done enough in his college career, however, deciding to put his name in the hat despite the intense rehabilitation ahead of him. Smith became the second player to win both the high school and college Butkus Awards as the nation‚Äôs top linebacker, joining former Notre Dame star Manti Te'o, by leading the Irish with 113 tackles, nine of which went for losses. It was the second straight season Smith topped the defensive stats chart in tackles (112) and made nine TFLs. In his first year on campus, Smith started all 13 games, making 67 stops, 6.5 for loss. It is expected that Smith will bounce back from his knee surgery to become the athletic, explosive defender that wowed scouts over the past three years.",7.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylon-smith/3200534d-4939-0302-215d-efdf00ed35e0
Joey Bosa,"Bosa plans to follow in the footsteps of his father and uncle as NFL first-round picks; John Bosa was picked 16th overall by Miami in 1987 coming out of Boston College, while Eric Kumerow was picked in the same spot, again by the Dolphins, the following year. Joey Bosa's own potential as an elite prospect has been clear since arriving in Columbus, as he made his way into the starting lineup 10 times as a true freshman (13.5 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks) to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten honors. As a sophomore, he captured unanimous All-American honors, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year award (led the conference with 21 tackles for loss, 13.5 sacks) and was named a finalist for three national awards as the nation‚Äôs top defender: the Lombardi Award, Outland Trophy, and Ted Hendricks Award. His junior year got off to a slow start, however, as he was suspended for the opener for violating team rules. Statistically, his 2015 season was not as impressive as the year before (16 tackles for loss, five sacks) but Big Ten coaches still named him the conference‚Äôs Defensive Lineman of the Year because of his rare combination of strength against the run and consistent presence in the backfield.",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joey-bosa/3200424f-5303-7607-7c15-97256422ae9e
Leonard Floyd,"It‚Äôs tough not to think of former Georgia star linebacker Boss Bailey when watching Floyd, a long, lean pass rusher. An all-state pick in his Georgia high school days, Floyd played a year at Hargrave Military Academy before heading to Athens (as many Georgia recruits do).  He started eight of 13 games played in 2013, receiving All-Freshman SEC notice after making 9.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks. Floyd was awarded the Bulldogs' Defensive MVP in 2014 (though he missed the team's bowl game having knee surgery) to go along with honorable mention all-conference honors from league media (8.5 tackles for loss, six sacks). In his final year between the hedges, Floyd led the Bulldogs in sacks for the third straight year (4.5) and tied for the team lead with 10.5 tackles for loss, garnering second-team All-SEC notice from league coaches. The 2015 Butkus Award finalist is no joke off the edge, as many college tackles would confirm.",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leonard-floyd/3200464c-4f75-8060-5a6d-d3aabc3c32e2
Jared Goff,"Instead of following the path of his father, Jerry, to major league baseball (played catcher for three teams over six seasons), Goff starred as a high school quarterback in the Bay Area. Cal coaches put him right into the fire in 2013, and he answered the challenge as the school's first-ever freshman opening weekend starting quarterback. The honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick (18 TD, 10 INT) set school records for passing yards (3,508), passes completed (320), and passes attempted (531) on a 1-11 team lacking great talent. He suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder in the ""Big Game"" against Stanford that year, but managed to return for the 2014 spring game.  In fact, he started all 12 games as a sophomore, completing 62.1 percent of his passes for 3,973 yards and 35 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. Goff capped his career at Cal with a first team All-Pac-12 season, starting every game and setting conference records with 4,719 passing yards and 43 touchdowns on the year. The Bears also won their first bowl game since 2008 when Goff threw for 467 yards and six touchdowns when they took out Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. Even before that victory, however, Goff decided to move on to the professional ranks after the season as one of the top quarterback prospects for the 2016 NFL Draft.",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jared-goff/3200474f-4621-9636-7354-d2eb6365d257
Vernon Hargreaves III,"Hargreaves carries the football genes of his father, Vernon II, who was on UConn's 100th anniversary's team and has coached linebackers and special teams for multiple schools (USF, Houston, Arkansas). He was the National Defensive Player of the Year by the Touchdown Club of Columbus as a senior high school, a finalist for the Florida Mr. Football award, and the Most Valuable Player of the Under Armour All-American game. So it was no surprise that he worked his way on the field as a true freshman, ranking among the leaders in the SEC with 14 passes defended, including three interceptions. Hargreaves not only earned first-team All-SEC honors in all three of his seasons in Gainesville, but also lined up multiple All-American honors in 2014 (three interceptions, 13 pass breakups) and 2015 (four interceptions, four pass break-ups) due to his playmaking ability.",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vernon-hargreaves-iii/32004841-5214-3957-d3dd-a46bc852de96
Hunter Henry,"Three years ago, the Razorbacks were delighted to have a legacy recruit in their backyard (Little Rock), who just happened to be one of the top tight end prospects in the country. His father, Mark, played offensive tackle for Arkansas from 1988 to 1991, serving as a team captain his senior year. Hunter didn't make it to his senior year, however, choosing to enter the 2016 NFL Draft after a spectacular junior season where he won the John Mackey Award as the nation‚Äôs top tight end and garnered consensus first team All-American honors. The first-team All-SEC pick by league coaches and media had 51 catches for 739 yards and three scores on the year. This production wasn‚Äôt out of the blue, given his recruiting status and production as a sophomore (37-513, two touchdowns receiving) and a true freshman in 2013 (28-409, four scores despite fighting issues in both knees).",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hunter-henry/32004845-4e61-7052-805d-daad1175a3b2

He led the Tide with 97 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and broke up six passes, winning SEC Defensive Player of the Year, numerous All-American honors and landing finalist spots for multiple national awards. In fact, Ragland was the third Alabama player to earn unanimous All-American notice, joining Cornelius Bennett and Derrick Thomas.

Jalen Ramsey,"Ramsey was a top-rated recruit (No. 10 overall by Rivals) out of Tennessee, stepping right into the fire in Tallahassee. In fact, he was the first freshman to start the opener at cornerback for the Seminoles since Deion Sanders 30 years earlier. Each year with FSU, he's garnered several honors, from Freshman All-American nod in 2013 () to All-American and first-team All-ACC accolades in both 2014 (79 tackles, 9.5 for loss, two interceptions, 12 pass break-ups) and 2015 (3.5 tackles for loss, 10 pass break-ups). Ramsey is not in Sanders‚Äô class as an athlete (though not many are), but he did win ACC indoor and outdoor long jump titles in 2015.

A'Shawn Robinson,"Nick Saban has made a habit of creating NFL defensive lineman during his time in Tuscaloosa, recruiting the best of the best from the high school ranks and making the most of their potential. Robinson was another one of those five-star recruits who came in ready to contribute. He played all 13 games (starting two) as a true freshman, making 38 stops, eight for loss, and leading the Tide with 5.5 sacks. Robinson displayed versatility by playing inside and outside as a sophomore, earning honorable mention All-SEC honors from league media as a full-time starter (6.5 tackles for loss) by splitting his time between the nose tackle and five-technique spots. He first gained the true attention of scouts that season when racking up nine tackles, three for loss, against Missouri in the SEC Championship Game. Robinson's career reached its apex in 2015, as he garnered consensus All-American honors and was named a finalist for the Outland Trophy.  He was one of the main cogs of the nation‚Äôs third-rated defense, making 46 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 15 games as the Tide won the national title.",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a-shawn-robinson/3200524f-4236-7960-bf20-bc060ac0f49c
Ronnie Stanley,"Stanley had a chance to leave for the National Football League after his third year in South Bend, but decided to return after watching Ohio State win the national championship in January of 2015. He wanted to be part of a national championship contender. Although that didn‚Äôt quite happen (Notre Dame lost games to conference champions Clemson and Stanford, each by two points before losing to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl), Stanley didn't hurt his draft stock with a 2015 second-team All-American season at left tackle. NFL scouts had hoped he would come out the year before, as he looked like a future pro while starting all 13 games at left tackle as the Irish's Offensive Lineman of the Year in 2014. Stanley started every game at the right tackle as a redshirt freshman (he played two early season games as a reserve in 2012), showing great promise. A durable, intelligent player with experience at both tackle spots, Stanley will be a coveted prospect.",7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronnie-stanley/32005354-4145-8230-6d67-2a4d1dc0dc12

Despite the high expectations, he somehow lived up to his billing. After contributing as a true freshman (two starts, 29 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss), Billings came into his own in 2014, receiving consensus first-team All-Big 12 notice with 37 tackles, 11.5 for loss.  The league named him co-Defensive Player of the Year in 2015, leading Baylor with 15 tackles for loss and tying for the team lead with 5.5 sacks as he heard his name mentioned on several All-American squads.

Jack Conklin,"In hindsight, it's difficult to comprehend that Conklin had zero scholarship offers from FBS-level colleges coming out of high school. The son of a high school football coach, Conklin had all of the tools to start with, which may have been why Michigan State came through with a preferred walk-on offer in the spring of 2012. He earned a scholarship halfway through his redshirt season, working over highly-recruited defensive ends in practice to earn their respect.  Conklin started 13 of 14 games in 2013, 10 at left tackle and three on the right side, to earn multiple Freshman All-American honors. More people started taking notice of his toughness and strength in his sophomore season, as both league coaches and media named him a second-team Big Ten player at left tackle. Even though Conklin missed two games in his junior campaign with a leg injury, he garnered All-American recognition from nearly every outlet in addition to consensus first-team All-Big Ten honors for his ability to protect quarterback Connor Cook. Conklin's leadership and skills on the line during his final year in East Lansing helped the Spartans climb the Ohio State hump and capture a much-desired Big Ten Championship.",6.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jack-conklin/3200434f-4e18-3999-915b-09982a3cecd4
Kevin Dodd,"Dodd was not as highly-touted as fellow defensive end Shaq Lawson coming into the 2015 season, but by the end of the year he was just as respected. The South Carolina native went to Hargrave Military Academy for the 2011 season before arriving in Clemson, and spent three years as a reserve (six tackles in eight games in 2012, seven tackles in four games in 2013, eight tackles, 2.5 for loss in 12 games in 2014) behind the Tigers‚Äô ever-talented defensive line before getting into the starting line-up on the strong side across from Lawson. Dodd's ascension was set back a bit by a knee injury in the 2013 season, but his play the following fall portended an excellent redshirt junior year. Dodd finished just behind his All-American teammate in tackles for loss (23.5) and sacks (12), receiving honorable mention all-conference notice from ACC coaches for his efforts. Those coaches might have voted him first team after the national championship game, however, as he lit up the Crimson Tide with five tackles for loss, including three sacks.",6.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-dodd/3200444f-4417-1178-4e6b-8465a2b3d365
Paxton Lynch,"Lynch was lost a bit in the recruiting process after sitting out half of his senior season due to a knee injury suffered in the preseason, allowing Memphis head coach Justin Fuente to nab the Florida product from the under the noses of in-state schools. He redshirted his first year on campus, but then stepped in to become a three-year starter for Fuente. Lynch went through some ups and downs in his first year as a starter, throwing nine touchdowns against 10 interceptions and completing just 58 percent of his passes for about 2,000 yards in 2013. He improved greatly as a sophomore, leading his team to a 10-win season and American Athletic Conference championship. He received second team All-AAC honors that season by completing 63 percent of his passes for 3,031 yards and 22 scores.  Lynch exploded onto the national scene during his junior year, garnering a Manning Award finalist nod, first team All-ACC honors, and team MVP after leading the Tigers to an 8-0 start before the team struggled down the stretch losing to Navy, Houston, and Temple. During the team‚Äôs hot streak, Lynch beat SEC foe Ole Miss with a 39-for-53, 386-yard, three-touchdown performance. But the next time he faced a SEC defense, Auburn took him to task in the Birmingham Bowl, forcing him to complete just 16 of 37 pass attempts for a measly 106 yards and an interception. Despite finishing the season on a down note, the departure of Fuente for Virginia Tech and positive accolades received from the NFL scouting community led Lynch to take his talents to the next level.",6.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/paxton-lynch/32004c59-4e52-6034-b52a-7cd4920cc667
Robert Nkemdiche,"Nkemdiche (kim-DEECH-ee) presented elite athleticism and quick-twitch movement as the top defensive end prospect in the country coming into Oxford as part of the 2013 recruiting class. He's one of the more interesting prospects in the 2016 draft class, as well, because Georgia native never really had great statistical production despite his manifold pro-ready characteristics. He started 10 games for the Rebels in 2013, garnering Freshman All-American and Freshman All-SEC notice with eight tackles for loss and two sacks on the year. In Nkemdiche's sophomore year, he received second-team All-American honors from several media outlets despite making just four tackles for loss and two sacks in 13 starts. His junior year realized similar results, again being named second team All-American with statistics half as impressive as most others named to the team (seven TFL, three sacks). Nkemdiche's career at Ole Miss ended on a sour note, however, as he was arrested for marijuana possession after taking a fall from an Atlanta area hotel room. He was suspended from the team's bowl game after the incident, and decided to leave for the National Football League.",6.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-nkemdiche/32004e4b-4541-5291-4305-2c4a48b9aedf
Laquon Treadwell,"Another one of Ole Miss' great recruiting pickups over the past few years, Treadwell was a five-star recruit, consensus All-American, and overall No. 1 receiver prospect in the country. Not surprisingly, he parlayed his talent to selection as the top freshman in the SEC in 2013 (72-608, five scores). Things were going swimmingly for Treadwell as a sophomore until he suffered a broken fibula against Auburn in the last month of the season; he finished with 48 catches for 632 yards and five touchdowns in nine games.  Despite the late-season injury, he worked hard (losing 25 pounds without any strength) to play in the 2015 season opener and helped the Rebels beat Alabama in mid-September (5-80, TD). Treadwell only got better as he gained confidence in his surgically-repaired leg, finishing the year with 82 catches, 1,153 yards, and 11 scores as a Biletnikoff Award finalist, All-American (second team Walter Camp, third team AP), and first-team All-SEC pick by league coaches. The icing on the cake for Treadwell was his performance in his final game for Ole Miss, catching three touchdowns against Oklahoma State in the Rebels' Sugar Bowl victory.",6.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/laquon-treadwell/32005452-4542-5415-7fdd-740fe9181fcb
Cody Whitehair,"As the Wildcats' strongest and most athletic lineman, Whitehair (6-4, 309) has been moved from right tackle to left guard, back to right tackle, and finally to left tackle for his last two seasons. His play on the blind side earned him first-team All-Big 12 honors in 2015 (following two second-team nods and an honorable mention as a freshman), as he not only possesses the footwork to hold off edge rushers but understands the angles needed to free space for running backs. His versatility and technique make him among the top linemen in the draft class.",6.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-whitehair/32005748-4961-7078-d810-97c67d57a346
Mackensie Alexander,"One of the most highly sought-after recruits in Clemson history, Alexander was ranked the fourth-best prospect in the country by ESPN coming out of high school. His work ethic and football acumen would have gotten him on the field as a true freshman in 2013 season, but he redshirted instead with a groin injury. Once Alexander got on the field, opponents found out why he was rated so highly. In 2014, he was named Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-ACC honors as a full-time starter. As a redshirt sophomore, he earned third-team All-American and first-team all-conference notice for locking down receivers. In fact, his lack of statistical production over the past two years (no interceptions, 11 pass breakups in 2014-2015) shows how little opponents challenged him.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mackensie-alexander/3200414c-4551-1379-a677-80cbb84f09ba
Jonathan Bullard,"The Gators have had a versatile defensive lineman selected in the first round in two of the last three drafts: Sharrif Floyd to Minnesota in 2013 and Dominique Easley by the Patriots in 2014. Bullard is looking to become the next in line. The former five-star recruit has moved between end and tackle during his career, showing off both quickness and power. He was fairly productive despite playing inside often as a junior (8.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks), but really turned on the juice as a senior (66 tackles, 17.5 TFL, 6.5 sacks), earning third team All-American honors from the Associated Press as well as consensus first team All-SEC honors.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-bullard/32004255-4c36-6378-5352-bcd27f50c265
Vernon Butler,"A big body in the middle of the Bulldogs' defense, Butler proved in his two years as a starter that he has the girth and nimble feet to clog up running lanes. Conference USA coaches rectified their error in not giving Butler all-conference recognition in 2014 (56 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss) by voting him first-team All-C-USA after his senior year (50 tackles, 10 TFL, three sacks, eight quarterback hurries). NFL teams will not miss the opportunity to add Butler to their interior.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vernon-butler/32004255-5459-9965-a779-9f97c4e4b972
Le'Raven Clark,"Clark started 51 straight games for the Red Raiders, spending his final three years at left tackle and his freshman season at right guard. All three years at left tackle, he earned All-Big 12 honors, and as a senior he was named a second-team All-American for his efforts. It's unclear where Clark's best position will be at the next level; he flashes the lateral agility and recovery speed to play on the edge against college pass rushers, so he should get a shot at left tackle. It‚Äôs possible, though, that Clark might be best inside where he can lock on and create creases for the running game. His durability, pro-ready body (6-6, 313), and next-level tenacity make him a likely NFL starter wherever he lines up.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/le-raven-clark/3200434c-4143-2150-9ff2-3f2c4170f288
Corey Coleman,"Coleman grew up in a tough Dallas neighborhood playing football in the streets, with a father who is currently serving prison time for felony cocaine distribution. But with the guidance and hard work of his mother, Cassandra Jones, as well as his godfather, former Baylor and NFL star defensive back Ray Crockett, Coleman fulfilled his potential as a playmaker at the college level. As a redshirt freshman, Coleman started 10 games in head coach Art Briles' offense, catching 35 passes for 527 yards and two scores, as well as averaging over 28 yards per kickoff return. His sophomore season started late, as he missed the first three games of the year with a hamstring injury, but finished strong. He was named second-team All-Big 12 (first team by the media) after covering 1,119 yards and scoring 11 times on just 64 receptions. Most importantly, Coleman came up big at the right times (15-224, TD vs Oklahoma, 7-150, TD vs Michigan in Cotton Bowl) ... but that was just a hint of things to come.  Coleman won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation‚Äôs top receiver in 2015, along with unanimous All-American and first-team all-conference honors, leading the country with 20 touchdown receptions (74-1,363 receiving for the year). He missed the team's Russell Athletic Bowl win over North Carolina after having sports hernia surgery in December in order to be ready for the run up to the 2016 NFL Draft.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-coleman/3200434f-4c23-2728-6b2b-151b26d6b37b
Su'a Cravens,"Cravens' extended family has several NFL ties, including cousin Jordan Cameron (former USC and current Miami Dolphins tight end), distant cousin Manti Te'o (Notre Dame/San Diego Chargers linebacker) and his mother's second cousin David Fulcher (former Arizona State and Cincinnati Bengals safety). While those genes portend great athleticism, Cravens made his own name as the USA Today National High School Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 (97 tackles, eight sacks, three INT). He graduated from Vista Murrieta High a semester early to join USC for 2013, securing a starting spot at strong safety the following fall despite injuring his knee in the spring. Cravens made various Freshman All-American teams as well as honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice (52 tackles, four interceptions). He moved to a safety/linebacker hybrid role as a sophomore (a change he strongly resisted at first), leading the team with 17 tackles for loss (five sacks) and three interceptions to earn third team AP All-American and first-team All-Pac-12 accolades. Cravens repeated those honors in 2015, topping all Trojan defenders with 86 tackles, 15 for loss, and 5.5 sacks and once again showing his overall game by intercepting two passes and breaking up two others.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/su-a-cravens/32004352-4153-4304-8902-accd5bf81476
Will Fuller,"Fuller had a difficult decision on whether to leave Notre Dame early for the National Football League. Like many underclassmen before him, he initially believed he would return to campus, and then upon reflection, decided it was time to move on to the next level. It's hard to fault him after being named the Irish team MVP with 62 receptions for 1,258 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2015. Fuller wasn't a one-year wonder, however, as he had an outstanding sophomore campaign (76-1,094, 15 TD) and showed big-play promise (6-160, one score).  He went to the same high school as Pro Football Hall of Fame candidate Marvin Harrison; Fuller‚Äôs lean build and ability to get deep on defenses will earn him comparisons based on their games as well as their upbringing.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-fuller/32004655-4c50-3598-6762-28495ce40669
Derrick Henry,"It's tough to accomplish more as a high school or college athlete than Henry did over the past five years. He won the 2012 Maxwell Club National High School Player of the Year award after setting a national record for career rushing yards (12,124, including 4,261 in his senior season) and scored 153 touchdowns. Then, despite breaking his leg in spring practices after graduating early from Yulee High (Florida), Henry averaged more than 10 yards per carry as a true freshman for the Tide (35-382, 3 TDs) and scored on a 61-yard reception -- his only one of the season. Even though the 6-3, 242-pound back started just two games as a sophomore, Henry consistently shared carries with T.J. Yeldon, covering 990 yards on just 172 totes (5.8 per) and scoring 11 times. He topped off his collegiate career by winning the 2015 Heisman Trophy, along with the Doak Walker, Maxwell, Walter Camp Player of the Year awards. The unanimous first-team All-American led the nation with 2,219 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns last fall, more or less winning the Heisman by racking up 213 yards and three touchdowns against LSU in a showdown with fellow trophy hopeful Leonard Fournette (who had 31 yards for the game).

Willie Henry,"Though Henry had 10 sacks playing for Ted Ginn, Sr. at powerhouse Glenville (Ohio) High, he was not highly regarded in recruiting circles. Each year we played for the Wolverines, however, he showed the improvement NFL scouts like to see when evaluating a prospects ""upside.""  In 2013, Henry was a strong contributor, starting six times and making 32 tackles, three for loss. He started six times again the next year, being credited with 20 tackles, 5.5 for loss, three sacks and an interception. Henry began fulfilling his potential during his final year in Ann Arbor, starting nine games and earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors, racking up 34 tackles, 10 for loss, and tying for the team lead with 6.5 sacks. After talking with former high school and college teammate Frank Clark, who was a second-round pick of Seattle in 2015, Henry decided it was time to leave for the NFL.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/willie-henry/32004845-4e71-3344-febf-15d76f5eb46d
Jordan Howard,"When Alabama-Birmingham decided to shut down its football program before the 2015 season, the Hoosiers found an outstanding player waiting for a new opportunity in Howard. The Alabama native had two very productive years for the Blazers, who stood by him during the recruiting process after he suffered a torn meniscus and a stress fracture in his pelvis during his junior year in high school. Howard earned five starts as a true freshman in 2013 (881 yards, 6.1 yards per rush average, two touchdowns) and then exploded for first-team All-Conference USA honors the next season. He actually set a UAB rushing record with 1,587 yards on a workhorse-level 306 carries in 2014, scoring 13 times. The step up to a Power Five conference didn't faze Howard, as he won over Big Ten coaches for first-team All-Conference honors (1,213 rush yards, 6.2 yards per rush, nine touchdowns; 11 catches, 106 yards, one touchdown receiving). Rushing for 174 yards against a tough Iowa squad, as well as 238 on 35 carries against Michigan, showed he has the talent to succeed at any level.",6.7,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-howard/3200484f-5723-9418-9826-088b7176f34d
Chris Jones,"A late-bloomer on a middling high school team, Jones went from unknown prospect to a top 50 prospect nationally during his senior year, leading the squad to their first-ever playoff win. Despite late pressure from other top schools, Jones stayed true to MSU, which is near his home in Houston, Miss. He started three games as a true freshman, receiving honorable mention All-SEC honors from league media after tying for the team lead with seven tackles for loss. Jones had a sophomore slump, however, making just 26 stops, 3.5 for loss, and playing a reserve role the entire season.

He wound up starting all 15 games in that redshirt freshman year for the national champion Buckeyes, earning multiple Freshman All-American accolades with 81 tackles, 16.5 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks. Lee truly hit the national stage by terrorizing Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, receiving Defensive MVP honors with seven tackles, three for loss, and two sacks.

Fackrell and his wife, Elizabeth, welcomed a baby girl (Delaney) into the word early in 2015.",6.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyler-fackrell/32004641-4335-5963-baa6-187c3472147d
Jordan Jenkins,"Jenkins, Georgia's Most Improved Player for the 2014 season (9.5 tackles for loss, five sacks), came out in a flash as a senior, racking up 11 tackles, 5.5 for loss and two sacks against Vanderbilt. Groin and hip injuries limited him throughout the year, however (59 tackles, 10.5 for loss, four sacks), keeping him off all-conference teams. Jenkins started six games as a true freshman(eight tackles for loss, five sacks) and earned second-team All-SEC honors as a sophomore (12 tackles for loss, five sacks) before truly coming into his own as a junior.",6.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-jenkins/32004a45-4e29-5944-da05-a9f046abd0ea
Austin Johnson,"Johnson is one of two Big Ten performers in his own family, as his sister, Kennedy, plays on the hardwood for Michigan State. He was an all-state performer in basketball during high school, and Cap-Atlantic Player of the Year as a senior, but as his 6-4, 325-pound frame continued to fill out, it was clear he belonged on the football field. Johnson sat out a redshirt season in 2012, then ate up room inside the next year, starting two games, making 27 tackles, two for a loss. In an honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore season, Johnson saved his best for last, racking up seven of his 49 tackles (six for loss) for the year in a Pinstripe Bowl win over Boston College. Somehow while earning all-conference honors (third team from coaches, second team from media) in 2015, Johnson managed to earn his journalism degree with the hopes of joining a broadcast crew once his NFL career is over -‚Äì which might be a while given the size and athleticism he showed while accumulating 78 tackles, 15 for loss, and six sacks last season.",6.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-johnson/32004a4f-4806-4658-caab-6f63e09bc955
Kentrell Brothers,"Undersized for an inside 'backer (a potential factor in the lack of interest by major programs in his home state of Oklahoma), Brothers recognizes plays quickly, works his way through traffic, and flows down the line very effectively as a run-stopper. His junior year was impressive (122 total tackles as a second-team All-SEC pick in 2014), but leading the nation in tackles per game (12.7, 152 total), making more plays in the backfield (12 tackles for loss) and proving himself able to make plays against the pass (two interceptions) and on special teams (three blocked kicks) made him an easy second-team All-American pick by the Associated Press and USA Today for 2015.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kentrell-brothers/32004252-4f20-4395-67c1-abe97c149b30
Kenny Clark,"Kenny Clark, Sr., went to prison in 2005, leaving 9-year-old Kenny, Jr. to mature faster than most of the boys his age. With the help of his mother and others, Clark maintained a good relationship with this father and turned the adversity into a positive, working hard to become an excellent high school player. He started four games as a freshman in 2013 (31 tackles, four for loss, one sack), then stayed a fixture in the lineup the following year. The 2014 second-team All-Pac-12 selection (58 tackles, 5.5 for loss) graduated to all-conference first team as a junior, using his strength and agility to finish second on the Bruins in tackles (75), tackles for loss (11) and sacks (six) despite lining up in the interior. Clark also showed a knack for batting down passes, breaking up five on the year.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-clark/3200434c-4140-9251-2f88-d454b8ae633b
Shon Coleman,"Many prospects in this draft class have faced adversity, but few have looked cancer in the eye and beaten it. In the spring of 2010, Coleman was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Over the next two-plus years, the top 10 offensive tackle national recruit worked at St. Jude‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital (located in his hometown of Memphis) to treat and defeat the disease. Coleman was finally cleared to play in the spring of 2012 and redshirted in the fall to get back into football shape. The following year he completed the comeback by playing six games as the backup to 2014 NFL Draft No. 2 overall selection Greg Robinson at left tackle. The past two seasons, Coleman has held down the blind side spot, starting every game and receiving second team All-SEC honors from league coaches. Casual college football fans and NFL scouts alike can see his frame and excellent length and agility, but should be more impressed by the mental toughness he‚Äôs shown over the past few years.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shon-coleman/3200434f-4c34-5946-6c72-6b23777f7397
Connor Cook,"Cook was the most intriguing senior quarterback prospect heading into the 2015 season, and he did not disappoint in his final campaign. He had already secured a place among the best quarterbacks in MSU history, throwing for nearly 6,000 yards, and tossing 46 touchdowns versus 14 interceptions in his sophomore and junior years -- garnering second team All-Big Ten honors both seasons. In 2015, he captured the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and Big Ten Quarterback of the Year Award, leading the Spartans to a spot in the College Football Playoff by throwing for 3,131 yards and 24 touchdowns (throwing seven picks). Cook completed just 56 percent of his passes as a senior, however, down from 58.7 percent and 58.1 percent the previous two years.  The Ohio native also fought off a shoulder injury, missing the win over Ohio State, but returning to help his team win their second Big Ten championship in three years. Cook won the MVP award in both the 2013 and 2015 Big Ten Championship Games.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/connor-cook/3200434f-4f04-5872-7e60-9148df96751c
Taylor Decker,"Ohio State's undisputed leader on the offensive line decided to come back for another year in Columbus instead of applying for entry into the 2015 draft, where he might have been a mid-to-late first-round pick. Decker not only got a chance to win back-to-back national titles during his senior year, but also an opportunity to prove he has the natural bend and elite athleticism (to go along with his obvious length, strength, and toughness) to be a top-five selection. The 2015 Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year played strong as the Buckeyes came up just short of reaching the College Football Playoff.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taylor-decker/32004445-4349-6460-9999-a94a63949256
Josh Doctson,"Doctson started his collegiate career at Wyoming before transferring back to his home state. He became Heisman Trophy candidate Trevone Boykin's favorite target (65 receptions, 1,018 yards, 11 TD) as a junior and ramped up his game even more in 2015, earning consensus first team All-American honors with a school-record 79 catches for 1,337 yards and 14 scores. Doctson only played in 11 games this year, only sparingly in one of those contests, as he suffered a wrist injury when players fell on him after a catch. The 2015 Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist finished second in TCU history in career receptions and yards, and set the record for touchdown receptions, despite starting his career at another school.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-doctson/3200444f-4366-2393-3396-cf5419f94811
Joshua Garnett,"Garnett, the son of an NFL nose tackle (Scott Garnett), played in the shadow of other NFL-ready Stanford linemen like 2015 first-round pick Andrus Peat before his senior year. He emerged from that shadow this fall, however, winning numerous All-American honors and the Outland Trophy as the nation‚Äôs top interior lineman. His combination of size (6-5, 325) and movement dropped jaws around college football -- especially when he takes an occasional turn as an H-back. Add intelligence and a nasty streak, and Garnett‚Äôs got everything an offensive line coach would want to be part of his group.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joshua-garnett/32004741-5234-0060-764b-345c327a0fd4
Germain Ifedi,"Ifedi's build screams ""NFL offensive lineman."" He's started the past three seasons for the Aggies, starting out as a Freshman All-American right guard blocking for Johnny Manziel the year after the star quarterback won his Heisman Trophy. The following season he moved to right tackle, starting 11 games while missing two due to a sprained MCL. It was hoped that Ifedi could take over the left tackle position in 2015 after the departure of Cedric Ogbuehi to the NFL, but he instead stayed on the right side. Ifedi was named second team All-SEC by league coaches for his work last year. Instead of returning to the Aggies for 2016, he decided to join his brother Martin (who starred as a defensive lineman at Memphis) in the National Football League.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/germain-ifedi/32004946-4513-6317-9ed7-242899e243f5
Ryan Kelly,"Kelly had big shoes to fill when he took over for Rimington Trophy winner Barrett Jones in 2013, but he's handled the pressure quite well. A taller, athletic pivot, Kelly was voted honorable mention All-SEC by league media as a junior, and even won the team's Offensive Player of the Week award twice during the year. He followed that up with a consensus first-team all-conference senior year, leading the way for a Heisman Trophy winner in back Derrick Henry and protecting quarterback Jake Coker on the way to the national title game.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-kelly/32004b45-4c73-8596-b66e-a1f975104e47
Keanu Neal,"Some safeties are content with ""catching"" ball-carriers during their tackle attempts. Neal prefers to make sure those with the ball have nightmares about ""42"" coming their way. The Florida high school all-state pick (151 tackles as a junior) stepped in to tie for the team lead in special teams tackles as a freshman, along with playing a reserve role at safety (five tackles on the year). Neal got the start in eight contests as a sophomore, missing two games with an injury but still managing 45 tackles and racking up three interceptions. He also missed the first two games of the 2015 season with an injured hamstring, but finished with 96 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks, and one interception. Neal joined cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III in leaving for the NFL early after his outstanding junior year.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keanu-neal/32004e45-4122-2964-6763-6eb5aa83fc3d
Charone Peake,"Named as one of the top 15 players in the country coming out of high school, big things were expected from Peake when he arrived at Death Valley. However, injuries and other rising stars (DeAndre Hopkins, Martavis Bryant and Sammy Watkins) held off his explosion on the scene until late in his career. Peake played in 14 games as a true freshman (4-71 receiving, 2-22 kick returns) and started two of 13 games played in a sophomore campaign (25-172, two TD receiving). Peake started the first two games of the 2013 season (8-84, one TD) before tearing his ACL in a September practice. He took a medical redshirt that season, and eventually made his way back onto the field the next season (four starts in seven games, 12-129, two TD receiving). Finally healthy and fully utilized with Deshaun Watson running an excellent Clemson offense that pushed the Tigers to the national championship game, Peake had the best year of his career in 2015 (50-716, five TD).",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charone-peake/32005045-4115-0300-a249-abd46ce12d03
Rashard Robinson,"Robinson's talent was never an issue during his time in Baton Rouge, but staying on the field was problematic.  He barely made the deadline for eligibility before his freshman season, but ended up playing in 12 games with two starts (16 tackles, interception, three pass break-ups). In 2014, he was not allowed to dress for the season opener against Wisconsin and started six of eight games played (17 tackles, one pass breakup) before being suspended indefinitely in November. Head coach Les Miles never reinstated Robinson for the 2015 season, so the defender sat out the season instead of transferring to another school. Without hope of re-joining the team in 2016, he entered the NFL draft as an early entrant.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashard-robinson/3200524f-4268-0485-1745-27d392dfc64a
Michael Thomas,"Thomas is the nephew of former USC and NFL star receiver Keyshawn Johnson, which portends an excellent pro career. His road to this spot has been bumpy at times, however. Passed over by USC and UCLA as a high school recruit, Thomas went to Fork Union Military Academy (where he roomed with OSU quarterback Cardale Jones) instead of accepting scholarship offers from second-tier programs. He played in 11 games as a freshman, catching just three passes (22 yards) for the Buckeyes, and then was redshirted for the 2013 season just one game in because he was struggling to learn the offense and make his grades. Just one year later, Thomas became the leading receiver (54 catches, 799 yards, nine scores) on a national championship squad. He proved 2014 wasn‚Äôt a fluke by once again leading the Buckeyes with 56 catches, 781 yards, and nine touchdowns this fall, garnering third-team All-Big Ten honors from league coaches and media. Thomas won't be picked No. 1 overall like his uncle, but an NFL team will see his potential as a Sunday playmaker.",6.3,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-thomas/32005448-4f30-8912-926a-d25d51327661
Eli Apple,"Though Apple was highly-recruited out of high school, Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer wasn't sure of what he had during the New Jersey native's first year on campus. But Apple was diagnosed with an iron deficiency that prevented him from giving full effort on the field, in the weight room, and in the classroom. Once that was under control, Meyer and the rest of the coaches saw Apple begin to fulfill his potential. Apple (whose given surname was Woodard, but changed it to honor his stepfather) started 14 of 15 games as a redshirt freshman during Ohio State's run to a national title. In fact, he sealed the Buckeyes' win over Oregon in the championship game, intercepting Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota's final collegiate pass. For the season, he totaled 53 tackles, 5.5 for loss, three interceptions and 10 pass breakups. Although Apple's statistical production decreased in 2015 (33 tackles, two for loss, one interception, eight pass breakups), Big Ten coaches recognized his ability to shut down opposing receivers by voting him second-team all-conference.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eli-apple/32004150-5019-5645-f1b8-2e24e42cc5eb
Vonn Bell,"Bell was a top 30 national recruit out of Georgia, but eschewed the overtures of Alabama and other SEC schools to play for Urban Meyer and the Buckeyes. His faith in Meyer was rewarded with a national championship in 2014, and the fact his team beat Saban's Crimson Tide in the title game was no small irony. Bell got on the field right way for OSU, playing as a reserve at the nickel spot most of his true freshman season before earning a starting spot in the Orange Bowl versus Clemson (seven tackles, interception). He was inserted into one of the safety spots for 14-of-15 contests in the Buckeyes' championship 2014 season, racking up 92 tackles, two for loss, six interceptions and six pass breakups. Though his statistics dropped a bit in his final year in Columbus (65 tackles, two interceptions, nine pass breakups), Bell's play was still impressive enough to receive 2015 second-team All-Big Ten honors from league coaches (first team from the media).",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vonn-bell/32004245-4c62-6378-1bac-df0e819ef17d
Devontae Booker,"The former Washington State signee and junior-college star ran just 31 times in his first three games with the Utes in 2014 -- then he ran for an average of 130 yards a game through the rest of the season. Booker followed up that performance with a second-team All-Pac-12 senior campaign (1,261 yards, 11 TD in 10 games) before a torn meniscus sidelined him early. His power, quickness, elusiveness in the hole, and receiving ability (80 receptions in 2014-2015) give him an excitement factor lacking from most collegiate backs.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devontae-booker/3200424f-4f01-9902-c146-57fda0468e8d
Artie Burns,"Burns has been as successful a two-sport athlete as any football player has been in the last 20 years. He came to ""The U"" with a pedigree on the football field and the track, earning four-star recruit status while winning a state title in the 110 meter hurdles three times during his high school career (he had the top 110 meter and 300 meter hurdles times in the nation in his junior year). Burns translated that dual success in high school to the Hurricanes, winning All-American and All-Conference honors as a hurdler for the track and field squad and becoming one of the top corners in the ACC. Burns played in a reserve role as a freshman in 2013 (17 tackles, two sacks, three pass breakups) before becoming a starter in his sophomore year (40 tackles, six pass breakups). He flourished in 2015, intercepting six passes (most by a Miami player since Sean Taylor had 10 in 2003) and breaking up five others on his way to consensus second-team All-ACC honors. Unfortunately, Burns also suffered a great loss during his junior year, losing his mother after she suffered a heart attack. Since his father has been incarcerated for some time, the University of Miami started a donation fund to help his family get through the rough period -- they raised $40,000 in six hours. It was not surprising, therefore, that he wanted to declare for the 2016 NFL Draft as an early entrant.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/artie-burns/32004255-5250-7944-5fac-fe438f13fc26
Shilique Calhoun,"Not many players are named to All-American squads once during their college career, much less twice. Calhoun's managed to earn the nod three straight years, making big plays for the Spartans as they competed for Big Ten titles. As a redshirt sophomore, Calhoun was the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year and first team all-conference recognition in addition to second team All-American notice from several sources after recording 14 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks, four fumble recoveries and an interception. The two-time Ted Hendricks Award finalist (2013, 2015) didn‚Äôt disappoint in his second year as a starter and first as a team captain, making 39 tackles, 12.5 for loss and eight sacks. Calhoun could have left for the NFL after 2014, but decided to return to compete for a Big Ten title and a national championship. The Spartans did accomplish the former, with the help of Calhoun‚Äôs 14.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks before losing to eventual champion Alabama in the College Football Playoff.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shilique-calhoun/32004341-4c42-2827-13a0-edfa592dfc47
Jeremy Cash,"The Blue Devils are looking for their first back-to-back drafts with a first-round pick in school history, and the former Ohio State Buckeye (he played five games as a true freshman in 2011 before transferring due to the change of coaches) has the sort of all-around game a team may covet enough to use an early pick to secure his services. He's a real presence in the box, as he showed during his sophomore season (121 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, four interceptions) and in another outstanding year in 2014 (111 tackles, 10.5 for loss, 5.5 sacks, two picks, seven pass breakups). Cash was recognized as a second-team All-ACC player, as well as receiving second team All-American notice, in both seasons.  In his senior year, Cash joined last year's first-round Blue Devil, guard Laken Tomlinson, as a consensus All-American by amassing 101 tackles, 18 for loss, 2.5 sacks, four pass break-ups, and three forced fumbles.  The Bronco Nagurski and Jim Thorpe Award committees named him a finalist, and ACC coaches named him not only the conference Defensive Player of the Year, but also its top scholar-athlete.  Unfortunately, Cash could not play in the team's bowl game against Indiana, sitting out the Pinstripe Bowl after having surgery on his right wrist.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-cash/32004341-5327-0566-aeb2-bb1e33c6e57b
Alex Collins,"It didn't take long for Collins, one of the most highly recruited high school running backs in the country, to make his mark for the Razorbacks. In fact, he was the first true freshman to start his career with three 100-yard performances since Adrian Peterson in 2004. Even though he shared carries with Jonathan Williams in his first two years on campus, Collins rolled up more than 1,000 yards each year (1,026 with 4 TD in 2013, 1,100 with 12 TD in 2014), joining Darren McFadden as the only Arkansas backs to accomplish that feat. With Williams out with an injury in 2015, Collins's carries increased from 204 in 2014 to 271 in 2015 as did his production (1,577 yards, 20 TD). He earned second team All-SEC honors in his final year, finishing behind Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry (Alabama) and Leonard Fournette (LSU).

Pharoh Cooper,"Many college football players are lacking in discipline, driving their coaches crazy. Cooper does not have that problem, as he grew up in a military family -- his grandfather and father were Marines, and his brother is a Marine. After winning back-to-back state high school titles in North Carolina, Cooper used his maturity to get on the field right away for the Gamecocks, receiving Freshman All-SEC honors as an all-purpose back and returner (359 kick return yards). Once given a chance to receive regular touches on offense, Cooper excelled, garnering consensus first team all-conference recognition as a receiver in 2014 (69-1,136, 11 TD) and second team honors as an all-purpose back (200 rushing yards, two scores). His production dipped a bit in 2015 (66-973, nine TD), but South Carolina's offense struggled in many ways this season.

He earned first-team All-Conference USA honors in 2015 (1,070 rush yds, 467 receiving yards, 26 total TD) despite missing two games with an ankle injury. Dixon had earned first-team all-conference notice in the WAC as a true freshman in 2012 (1,194 yards, 27 rush TD) and second-team All-Conference USA the last two years as he hit 1,000 yards rushing (1,299) in 2014 and 917 as a sophomore while fighting a knee injury.

Thomas Duarte,"NFL scouts don't care one bit about the ethnicity of college football prospects; it's the ultimate color-blind evaluation because either guys can play, have the potential to become players in time, or just don‚Äôt have the necessary skill set. Duarte's growing up in a household with Mexican and Japanese influences give him a unique background, but scouting his outstanding skill set as a playmaking receiver is what interests general managers across the league. The four-star wide receiver recruit from successful Mater Dei High School (where his number was retired) jumped into the fray as a true freshman, playing in 13 games with four starts and garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 (16-214, four TD). Duarte was picked as honorable mention all-conference selection again in 2014, leading the conference with an average 19.3 yards per reception from the tight end position (28-540, four TD). Joining forces with freshman phenom quarterback Josh Rosen last season, Duarte became a second-team all-conference pick by catching 10 touchdowns among his 53 catches that covered 872 yards (16.5 per).",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/thomas-duarte/32004455-4142-6541-44fe-c1821b79dacd

Hooper's next in line, leaving for the pros after his redshirt sophomore season. His father actually played at San Diego State, but his uncle, Greg, suited up for Stanford as a fullback from 1979-1982. Those genes were obvious during his two years on the field, first as a redshirt freshman in 2014 where he earned Freshman All-American and second-team All-Pac-12 honors (40-499, two scores). He helped Stanford win a conference championship in his second season, garnering several honors (Mackey Award finalist, third-team AP All-American, first-team All-Pac-12) by catching 34 passes for 438 yards and six touchdowns.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-hooper/3200484f-4f57-0770-bd7c-1cf59d6025ab

He stepped up his game as a junior to become a second-team American Athletic Conference pick (two interceptions, 10 pass breakups), ranking among the national leaders in pass breakups before suffering a sprained MCL late in the year. Jackson tweaked a knee during 2015, but started 12 of 13 games, again was named second-team all-conference and finished with five interceptions and 23 pass breakups, leading the nation in passes defended.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/william-jackson/32004a41-4364-5516-1a9f-87dcd74055ee
Karl Joseph,"Ironically, Joseph's play style of a complete lack of respect for his own body was not the reason he missed more than half of his senior season. He injured his knee in a non-contact practice drill, putting a stop to his best year to date, where he led the FBS in interceptions (five) after four weeks. Joseph flies into the backfield and attacks receivers in space like few others in this draft class, as he showed during his first-team All-Big 12 junior campaign (92 stops, 4.5 for loss, one interception, three pass break-ups, three forced fumbles.) Joseph started every game as a freshman (team defensive player of the year with 104 tackles, seven for loss, two interceptions, three forced fumbles) and sophomore (68 tackles, three for loss, one interception), as well, earning honorable mention all-conference recognition each season.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/karl-joseph/32004a4f-5321-9381-a66d-a3ef93d98b40
Miles Killebrew,"It‚Äôs easy to mistake Killebrew for a linebacker, both because of his physique but also due to his hard hits. The four-year starter earned All-Big Sky recognition in each season: honorable mention in 2012 and 2013, second team in 2014, and first team in 2015. Killebrew reached the triple-digit mark in tackles the past two seasons (101 in 2014, 132 in 2015) and also showed an ability to handle his pass coverage responsibilities each year (three interceptions, one for a touchdown in 2014, seven pass break-ups in 2015). Killebrew was also named second team All-Big Sky last year after blocking two kicks. Special teams acumen and defensive productivity should earn him similar grades to FCS star safety Jaquiski Tartt (Samford), who was picked in the third round of the 2015 draft.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/miles-killebrew/32004b49-4c28-3492-57d3-042b96cef5b8
Nick Martin,"Teams already know what to expect from Nick, as his brother Zack excelled in his first two seasons with Dallas after being selected in the first round in 2014. Nick will bring versatility along with the family toughness to an NFL team. He moves between center and guard without an issue (started at left guard 10 games in 2014, three games at center that year as well as most of 2013 and all of 2015), displaying a strong anchor in pass pro and nimble feet to attack linebackers in the run game. Teams envying the Cowboys' prodigious but athletic front line should consider picking up this Golden Domer.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-martin/32004d41-5268-5408-eb34-9cdf29b7867a
Harlan Miller,"Miller was named third-team FCS All-American by The Associated Press as a junior, despite fighting through a dislocated shoulder that cost him three games. He then improved that honor to second-team AP All-American in 2015. Miller picked off 11 passes and broke up 22 others over the past three years using his height and length, earning first team All-Southland Conference honors each season. Miller also proved he could make plays on the other side of the line of scrimmage as a senior, making six tackles for loss, while additionally returning punts (15 for 175 yards), receiving first-team all-conference notice at that position. He looks to join former teammate Robert Alford (drafted in the second round by Atlanta in 2013) in the league.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/harlan-miller/32004d49-4c28-1637-6514-0c2dd03b05c7
Rees Odhiambo,"The native of Kenya has been impressive over the past three years when healthy, displaying pro-caliber footwork and a solid anchor in pass protection while earning All-Conference honors the past two years (second-team in 2014, first-team in 2015). However, Odhiambo (pronounced AH-dee-AHM-bo) has not been able to start more than nine games in any season due to injuries (he broke his ankle in this season‚Äôs ninth game). Still, whether he serves as an undersized tackle or proves strong enough to move inside (like former Boise State LT Daryn Colledge), Odhiambo has starter-quality skills.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rees-odhiambo/32004f44-4829-6636-5b54-af1fb04ba4be
Paul Perkins,"Seeing Perkins succeed as a college running back is not surprising, given that his father Bruce (whose first name is actually Paul) played fullback for two years in the NFL and his uncle Don played eight years for the Dallas Cowboys. His younger brother, Bryce, redshirted at Arizona State (where Bruce played) last year, as well. Living up to the family name can be challenging, but Perkins showed great promise as a redshirt freshman by starting six games and finishing as the team's top rusher after athletic quarterback Brett Hundley (134-573, six touchdowns). Hundley didn‚Äôt have to run as much in 2014, handing the ball to Perkins 251 times and watching the back go for a Pac-12 best 1,575 yards and nine touchdowns (plus 26 passes to Perkins for 201 yards and two scores). He somehow was only voted honorable mention all-conference for that performance, but coaches wised up in 2015, naming him to their second-team after another excellent season (1,343 yards, 14 TD rushing; 30-242, one TD receiving).",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/paul-perkins/32005045-5222-7681-78c6-eac7d46b0bc6
Demarcus Robinson,"Despite Robinson's athletic prowess, his ability to take advantage of those gifts, or to stay out of trouble, short-circuited his career in Gainesville. He was suspended four times with the Gators (twice in 2013), including once late in the 2015 season, to go along with two benchings in his final year on campus. The nephew of former South Carolina and NFL receiver Marcus Robinson, Demarcus was a major recruiting coup for the Gators as an all-state pick from Georgia. He played in only seven games as a freshman, though, due to two suspensions (5-23 receiving). Robinson took a step forward as a sophomore, catching 53 passes for 810 yards and seven touchdowns. His statistics dropped in 2015, however, as he played 13 games but could only manage 522 yards and two scores on 48 receptions as the Gators' offense struggled all season long.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demarcus-robinson/3200524f-4239-9065-1db8-5ff5da8a3829
Sterling Shepard,"Shepard wears the same jersey number (3) as his late father, Derrick Shepard, who lettered for the Sooners as a receiver in the 1980s. Despite his slight frame, Shepard's toughness, strong hands, and quick cuts make him the sort of in-space player NFL offensive coordinators want working the middle of the field. Shepard‚Äôs production greatly increased from his second-team All-Big 12 2014 season (51 catches, 970 yards, five touchdowns) to his USA Today second-team All-American senior season (86-1,288-11).",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sterling-shepard/32005348-4549-5754-5697-2a8312edc489
Landon Turner,"An absolute road grader, Turner has turned the heads of NFL general managers with his ability to move the line of scrimmage. The three-plus year starter at right guard followed up a third-team All-ACC junior campaign with an first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference senior year.

Though he was not utilized to his full potential in the Buckeyes‚Äô passing attack, there‚Äôs no reason that he shouldn't be as valued as former teammate Jeff Heuerman, who was a 2015 third-round pick of the Denver Broncos. He has NFL size and hands, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten selection with 19 catches for 162 yards in 2015. Vannett had similar production (19-220) but more red zone targets (scoring five times) as a junior after spare usage as a redshirt freshman (two starts, 9-123) and sophomore (8-80, one TD).",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-vannett/32005641-4e64-3509-b1ce-15322f2faec9

He excelled last fall in his first season as a starter for the Sun Devils, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice for his stout play and mobility at left guard. Westerman's play his senior campaign did not disappoint, as his attitude, stoutness, mobility, and solid technique made him a second-team all-conference performer.",6.2,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-westerman/32005745-5365-2137-e016-f92bceb84632
Roberto Aguayo,"What do you do for an encore after winning the Lou Groza Award as the nation's top kicker? How about lead the nation in field goal percentage one year, and then become the first three-time All-American to play for the 'Noles since Deion Sanders? Not bad. Among his other accomplishments, Aguayo was a major player in the team‚Äôs 2013 national championship, setting FBS records with 157 points scored and 94 point after tries without a miss.  He also made 21-of-22 field goal attempts on the year.  The three-time first team All-ACC pick by league coaches set a conference record by making 198 straight extra points ‚Äì every one in his storied career. Aguayo led the NCAA in field goal percentage in 2014, making 27-of-30 attempts, though he fell off a bit as a junior (21-26, just 5-for-10 from 40 or more yards away). He had 47 touchbacks in 84 kickoffs in 2015 (56 percent, up from 51 percent in 2014 and 37.5 percent in 2013), presenting leg strength NFL special teams coaches covet.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/roberto-aguayo/32004147-5508-0357-280b-fbf84b467bb9
Dominique Alexander,"Football is a family affair for the Alexanders. His father, Derrick, Sr., played at Oklahoma State and his brother, Derrick, Jr., is also heading toward an NFL career after excelling as a defensive lineman at Tulsa. Alexander's natural football acumen shone through in his first year with the Sooners, winning the Big 12 Defensive Freshman of the Year by starting the final eight games, making 80 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and forcing two fumbles. He started all 13 games each of the next two seasons, earning second-team All-Big 12 honors from the Associated Press in 2014 (107 tackles, six for loss, 1.5 sacks) and first-team all-conference accolades from coaches as a junior (103 tackles, seven for loss, 1.5 sacks).

Jack Allen,"When an NFL offensive line coach sees that a young lineman was a high school wrestler, a smile comes across his face. Grappling in the trenches is what a lineman does -- and is something at which Allen excels. The former Illinois state title holder at 285 pounds is not the largest center in the country, but no other ""man in the middle"" matches this four-year starter's toughness, anchor, and aggressive nature.

Jacoby Brissett,"Brissett's build (6-foot-4, 235), strong arm, and ability to pick up first downs with his feet will intrigue teams looking for a potential starter in a draft lacking great talent at the position. Brissett started his career at Florida, but transferred to N.C. State due to a recruiting relationship with head coach Dave Doeren. He‚Äôs started every game the past two years, shining against Florida State (32-for-48, 359 yards, three touchdowns) in 2014, which portended a nice senior year that saw him earn honorable mention All-ACC honors (2,662 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, six interceptions).",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacoby-brissett/32004252-4951-6391-fb1e-f908d9b96e12
Maliek Collins,"Not only was Collins an outstanding football player at Kansas City Central High School (first-team all-state with 43 tackles for loss and 15 sacks as a senior), but a championship wrestler who won a state title at 48-0 in his final year. That combination is gold to NFL scouts, who love defensive linemen who have used their hands to grapple on the mat as well as the gridiron. Collins contributed in his first year on campus in 2013, playing all 12 games and starting the team's bowl game (12 tackles, two for loss, one sack). His star power began to shine in his sophomore year, garnering second team All-Big Ten accolades and team Defensive co-MVP with 45 tackles, 14 for loss, and 4.5 sacks. Though he started 12 of 13 games in 2015, Collins' production dropped: 29 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks.

Kamalei Correa,"For three straight years, a member of the Boise State Broncos has left school early for the NFL Draft. Correa follows defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (picked by Dallas in the second round of the 2014 draft) and running back Jay Ajayi (fifth round, Miami, 2015). This year's early entrant is Correa, native of Honolulu, Hawai'i. He earned second-team All-Mountain West accolades in 2015, leading the Broncos with 11 tackles for loss and seven sacks on the year. Two of those sacks came in his last game with the Broncos, a win over Northern Illinois in the Poinsettia Bowl. Those numbers were actually down from Correa's sophomore year stats, when he was named first team all-conference after leading the Mountain West with 12 sacks and finishing third with 19 tackles for loss.

Sheldon Day,"Day plays stronger than his measurements might indicate. Heady and hustling, he also holds his ground against double teams and may have the best hands of any lineman in the draft. Day played inside and outside for the Irish, regularly making plays in the backfield in 2015 (15.5 tackles for loss, four sacks, 13 quarterback hurries) on his way to USA Today first-team All-American honors.

Kendall Fuller,"Fuller was the fourth Fuller brother to suit up for Virginia Tech, and will be the fourth to play in the NFL, and probably the most talented of them all. Vincent played seven years in the league as a safety, Corey lines up as a reserve receiver for the Detroit Lions, and Kyle has played well at corner for Chicago after they made him a first-round pick in 2014. Kendall, a high school All-American, simply came into Bud Foster's defense as a true freshman, starting 12 games, intercepting six passes, and garnering Freshman All-American, second-team All-ACC and Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. Fuller continued to impress in his sophomore year, earning second team All-American notice from multiple outlets and first team all-conference nods from coaches and media alike (4.5 tackles for loss, two interceptions, 15 pass breakups) -- all while playing with a fractured wrist on which he had surgery after the season. Unfortunately, the injury bug bit Fuller again before the 2015 season, as he tore the meniscus in his right knee during preseason camp. He attempted to play through the injury, but decided to hang it up after three games (seven tackles, sack) to have it repaired. Rather than return to Virginia Tech after head coach Frank Beamer retired, Fuller decided to head to the next level as an early draft entrant to join his brothers.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kendall-fuller/32004655-4c34-2614-e83f-6a7a6f7cab25
Graham Glasgow,"Left guard, right guard, center: wherever he lines up, Glasgow is a tough blocker that shows enough mobility to make creases for running backs. Glasgow started at right guard as a junior before moving into the pivot for 2015 after incumbent Jack Miller ended his football career due to concussions. Glasgow's nine starts there in 2013 made it an easier move, allowing him to lead a rejuvenated Michigan offense and garner consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors with his play.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/graham-glasgow/3200474c-4134-9413-66c9-455073290215
Adam Gotsis,"Though he spent more time playing Australian Rules football than American football growing up in Melbourne, Gotsis was a quick learner. He starred for a local club team before heading to Atlanta, and then played well as a true freshman against ACC competition. The 2014 consensus second-team all-conference pick is still raw, and played out of position as an interior lineman for Tech's defense considering his lack of bulk. He garnered 2015 third-team All-ACC accolades with 31 tackles, five for loss, and three sacks in nine games, but saw his season cut short with a November knee injury suffered against Virginia.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/adam-gotsis/3200474f-5442-8790-f92b-449fa59cd136

Greene made headlines for the wrong reason, however, as SDSU head coach Rocky Long suspended him along with four other players for six games after positive tests for marijuana. Contrite for his mistake, Greene came back to start the final seven games of the year, helping the team produce two 1000-yard rushers for the first time in school history. The 2014 honorable mention All-Mountain West selection will have to answer the same questions about the suspension again and again during the pre-draft process, but also has enough good tape to make teams take the time to consider his talent.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrell-greene/32004752-4542-4200-95c8-bfbf10a4336a

But Hawkins managed to win the starting job at right tackle as a redshirt freshman, even playing on the blind side for an injured La'el Collins in one contest.  The Louisiana native started every game at right tackle in 2014, as well, before moving to Collins' left tackle spot this fall. He missed the contest against Ole Miss with an ankle injury, but started the other 12 games in his final season in Death Valley.

Higbee could be the best of the trio. The converted receiver added weight to his frame and when given the chance to show his stuff against Marshall as a junior, made six catches for 99 yards and three scores. He built on that in 2015, teaming up with two-time Conference USA MVP to put up some of the best numbers for any tight end in the country (38-563, eight TD) despite missing five-plus games with a knee injury.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-higbee/32004849-4703-3222-e4e8-bd596550bfdb

He has prototypical size and plenty of speed to make plays in the deep secondary, intercepting four passes, returning one for a 94-yard score in 2015. Houston-Carson also possesses secure tackling skills which helped him lead the team with 109 stops on the year (4.5 for loss). ""DHC"" started as a redshirt freshman (55 tackles, one interceptions, seven pass breakups) and sophomore (62 tackles, 4.5 TFL, 2 INT, 11 PBU), too.

Bragging that he was the ""best athlete in college football"", Miller looked prophetic with outstanding open-field moves and speed in the limited opportunities he received this season (24 catches, 329 yards, three TD receiving; 40 carries, 234 yards, one TD rushing).

Will Redmond,"A four-star recruit from Memphis, Redmond got caught up in a recruiting mess that gave him and his family impermissible benefits. The NCAA investigated the situation, and did not allow him to play as a freshman at MSU. Redmond only played in eight games as a sophomore and didn't start a game for the Bulldogs in 2014 because of the depth they had at the position. Still, teams made a mistake throwing his way that year as he had a team-best three interceptions (along with five breakups) as a junior. Two of those interceptions sealed victories for Mississippi State in the fourth quarter. Once Redmond finally got the starting job as a senior (25 tackles, two INT, one PBU), he could only watch the second half of the season after tearing his right ACL in practice.

KeiVarae Russell,"The story of Russell's career at Notre Dame took a sharp left turn in August of 2014, as he and four of his teammates were suspended for academic improprieties. The prolonged investigative process cost him the 2014 season and 2014-15 school year, although he kept himself busy with community college courses, a job, and a strong workout program so he could return in 2015. He started 11 games for the Irish in his final season on campus, making 60 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions and four pass breakups. Russell was actually considered one of the top running back recruits in the country coming out of high school, but moved to the secondary for the Irish before his freshman season. The move paid immediate dividends, as he started all 13 games earning Freshman All-American honors (58 tackles, two interceptions). Russell started every game again in 2013 (51 tackles, eight pass breakups), finishing strong with his lone interception of the year and three pass breakups against Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keivarae-russell/32005255-5358-5854-c0e7-ea512c954c1d
Zack Sanchez,"A two-time first-team All-Big 12 pick from Fort Worth, Texas, Sanchez has been a stalwart for the Sooners since taking the starting job as a redshirt freshman in 2013. He started 37 games over the past three years, missing two games this fall with a right leg injury. His slight frame worries scouts, and some questioned Sanchez's decision to leave early for the NFL, but there's no doubting his ability to play the ball (15 interceptions, 28 pass break-ups over the past three seasons). Sanchez received 2015 second team All-American notice from multiple outlets, as he not only picked off seven passes, but had 45 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and seven pass breakups.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zack-sanchez/32005341-4e09-4981-f0f7-5e7505a39a86
Jason Spriggs,"Spriggs excelled in his senior season, catching second-team All-Big Ten accolades along with the eyes of scouts. The four-year starter also was named first team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America and third-team honors by the Associated Press. Spriggs had a scary moment on the field in 2014 against Michigan State, as he was taken to the hospital after suffering a helmet-to-helmet blow. But since them he has shown the build (6-foot-7, 307 pounds), anchor in pass protection and willingness to block through the whistle to be the type of prospect NFL offensive line coaches will covet at left tackle.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jason-spriggs/32005350-5215-0252-7d93-dd095a1e8449
Darian Thompson,"Thompson received All-American recognition in each of the past two seasons. After picking off seven passes in 2014, he added five more in just 11 games this season, totaling 19 for his career (tied for the most of any player in the country). But the 6-foot-2, 205-pound defender isn't just a ballhawk -- he is a physical presence in the secondary and solid tackler in space (242 career tackles) and behind the line of scrimmage (8.5 tackles for loss in 2015). Another impressive season in 2015, even though he missed the final two regular season games with a concussion, cemented his status as one of the best all-around safeties in the draft class.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darian-thompson/32005448-4f50-7692-d87a-6350d02b5af0
Max Tuerk,"Going into the season, it appears this Trojan was on a path similar to the versatile Cameron Erving, the No. 19 overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2015 draft. Tuerk has started at nearly every place along the line for the Trojans. He is a bit taller and more slender than most pro pivots, but that may still be his best spot given that he used his mobility and tenacity to earn first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2014. Unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in October and will have to prove himself before the draft to maximize his grades.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/max-tuerk/32005455-4556-3609-aa22-77f0c7070fe7
Jihad Ward,"Considering that Jihad (pronounced juh-HODD) Ward went from receiver/safety to the defensive line during his time in junior college, the sky's the limit once he really knows what to do with his size and strength. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection by league coaches (51 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss, three sacks, four fumble recoveries) in his first season with the Illini, playing inside and outside and using his huge wingspan to swallow ball carriers. Ward, who wears jersey number 17 because that was his mother‚Äôs age when he was born, didn‚Äôt have the same production as a senior (3.5 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks) but still earned honorable mention notice due to his strong play.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jihad-ward/32005741-5220-8421-e203-445db831af6b
Adolphus Washington,"Washington showed himself ready to play for his senior season by racking up four sacks in Ohio State's spring game. Following up an honorable mention All-Big Ten junior season (10.5 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks), played even better in 2015. He earned second-team All-Conference honors from league coaches and media, as well as first-team All-American by the Sporting News (49 tackles, seven for loss, four sacks). Unfortunately, his judgment and maturity may be questioned by scouts after he was suspended for Ohio State's bowl game for soliciting a vice squad officer in early December.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/adolphus-washington/32005741-5301-3310-25b4-0e6c9c214ab3
D.J. White,"White made one of the more impressive plays of the 2014 season when he used his speed to chase down Pitt star running back James Conner on a 74-yard run to knock the ball out just before they reached the end zone. That hustle combined with his ability to make plays in coverage turned White into an honorable mention All-ACC selection in 2014 (team-best four interceptions, eight pass breakups). He played well again as a senior (41 tackles, two interceptions, eight pass breakups), making himself a coveted prospect at a prime position.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-j-white/32005748-4915-1510-f1ab-ab95ebd08a21
Jonathan Williams,"Williams was a second-team all-conference performer in 2014 with 1,190 yards and 12 touchdowns rushing, despite the fact that he shared carries with junior Alex Collins for the second straight year (he had 900 yards and four touchdowns as a sophomore). Williams missed the 2015 regular season after undergoing foot surgery, but decided he was better off entering the league instead of taking advantage of a redshirt (he played 11 games, starting two, as a true freshman). The thickly built and athletic Williams has the strength to return from this injury and excel as an NFL rookie.",6.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-williams/32005749-4c38-4555-6a9c-d6163c44fa20
Jerell Adams,"Adams took over as the primary target after Rory Anderson went down with an injury in 2014 and excelled, using his height and strider's speed to finish with 21 catches for 279 yards and one score on the year. Even in a year in which the Gamecocks struggled to move the ball through the air (they ranked in the bottom quarter of the FBS), he set career highs with 28 catches for 421 yards and three touchdowns. The former star high school basketball player has the physical skills to excel as a receiver and blocker in the NFL.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerell-adams/32004144-4140-0343-fd0c-4595e9eb7550
Bralon Addison,"Addison was a first-team all-state quarterback in Texas his senior year, but it was clear his collegiate future was at the receiver position.  He played wideout in the U.S. Army All-American game, and didn't miss a beat once in Eugene, making 22 catches for 243 yards and three scores as a true freshman. After fully adjusting to the college game, his sophomore season effort earned him honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolades as a receiver (61-890, seven TD) and also averaged 14.1 yards per punt return, scoring twice. Addison‚Äôs ascension to the top of the college football world hit a roadblock in the spring of 2014, however, as he tore his ACL during a practice.  The roadblock proved to be just a hiccup, though, as he returned to his explosive self in 2015, garnering second-team All-Pac-12 honors (63-804, 10 TD receiving; 12.6 average, one TD on punt returns) before deciding to take his quickness to the NFL.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bralon-addison/32004144-4448-1098-6b9f-609c184948cc
Vadal Alexander,"After starting for two years next to La'el Collins at left guard (earning second-team All-SEC honors as a junior), Alexander moved back to right tackle (where he earned freshman All-American honors in starting the final seven games in 2012) for his senior year. He played well enough on the outside to earn first-team All-SEC honors in 2015. Alexander shed at least 30 pounds since arriving on campus, giving him a shot to stay at tackle when he arrives in the NFL. Otherwise, he projects as a powerful inside player.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vadal-alexander/3200414c-4564-7460-5fc9-5db2be766768
Brandon Allen,"A three-year starter for the Razorbacks, Allen really came on in the second half of his senior year to open the eyes of scouts. In fact, the Fayetteville native, son of the school's director of high school and NFL relations, and one-time Arkansas High School Player of the Year improved each year. He completed less than 50 percent of his passes for 1,552 yards and 13 touchdowns as a sophomore, hit 56 percent of his passes for 2,285 yards and 20 scores in 2014, and then connected on 66 percent of throws in 2015 for 3,340 yards and 30 touchdowns (against just eight interceptions). This improvement isn't lost on the eyes of NFL teams.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-allen/3200414c-4c06-3816-a995-21614b984798
Willie Beavers,"At the end of Beavers' redshirt freshman year, Broncos coaches did something they wouldn't regret: start him at left tackle. He's been a stalwart on the blind side ever since (40 straight games), playing with a strong base, good feet, and excellent tenacity as a pass protector and run blocker. The 2015 first-team All-MAC (second team in 2014) pick‚Äôs size is only average, at best, for a tackle, but he'll get his shot.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/willie-beavers/32004245-4181-3394-1262-364da1600542
Evan Boehm,"One of the top offensive line recruits in the country coming out of high school, Boehm stepped right onto the field for the Tigers in 2012 -- and hasn‚Äôt left the lineup since. He started 52 straight games for head coach Gary Pinkel, playing freshman year at left guard and then three straight years in the pivot. Boehm is a thick interior lineman who has a strong anchor and can move his feet well for the position, portending a long NFL career.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/evan-boehm/3200424f-4521-7532-ce93-f21a58593779
Moritz Boehringer,"Boehringer played for the Schwbisch Hall Unicorns of the German Football League. In the 2015 season, Boehringer had 59 receptions for 1,232 yards and 13 touchdowns in 16 games played.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/moritz-boehringer/3200424f-4523-1032-5573-d1d2729f5388
Anthony Brown,"The Boilermakers had one of the worst pass defenses in college football in 2015, but Brown shouldn't be blamed for that performance. He intercepted four passes on the year (the first four of his career), breaking up six others (giving him 19 in three years as a starter). One of Brown's strengths is his tackling ability (110 in 2014-2015), as he's willing to throw his body into a play. Combining good athleticism with some physicality makes Brown a potential special teams contributor and reserve corner at the next level.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-brown/32004252-4f26-6417-50b1-3b13a5b426b0
Aaron Burbridge,"The former top national recruit went from a solid contributor (29 catches, 358 yards, one score) as a junior to a big-time playmaker for quarterback Connor Cook and the Spartans in 2015. Burbridge was named the Big Ten Receiver of the Year as a senior, as well as first-team all-conference by league coaches and media after nabbing 85 catches for 1,258 yards (with seven touchdowns). Both those figures led the Big Ten, becoming just the second Spartans player to lead the conference in that category (Kirk Gibson in 1976 and 1978). When Cook went back to pass, his first, second and third looks were to Burbridge as he trusted his teammate to make the clutch third-down catch as well as high-point the deep ball.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aaron-burbridge/32004255-5201-2358-cb4e-fc173afba1b6
Juston Burris,"Burris has been an excellent performer, physical and reliable, since his redshirt freshman season for the Wolfpack. The defensive back made five starts at the nickel spot that first year, playing in every game and intercepting three passes on the year (also with 43 tackles, eight pass break-ups.) In year two, Burris became a full-time starter (53 tackles, interception, 11 PBU). His stats dropped a bit in his junior year (29 tackles, one INT, five PBU) but rebounded a bit in 2015 (38 tackles, three TFL, one INT, seven PBU).",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/juston-burris/32004255-5260-8462-2be5-1dae38940357
Devon Cajuste,"Cajuste is a similar prospect to the Carolina Panthers' second-round pick last April, Devin Funchess. Both have large receiver builds that can create mismatches in goal-line situations and in the middle of the field. Though he didn‚Äôt duplicate his outstanding junior year (34 catches, 557 yards, six scores -- two against Maryland in the Foster Farms Bowl) in 2015, a lack of opportunities seemed the most likely reason for his 27-reception, 383-yard, three-touchdown effort. Against Notre Dame in November, however, Cajuste showed his real potential by catching five passes for 125 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinal's rival.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devon-cajuste/32004341-4a65-2601-c652-3a842b5a12b7
Jake Coker,"Coker was inconsistent, at best, this season as the starter for the Crimson Tide after getting on the field in just 17 games while at Florida State (2011-2013) and his first year at Alabama. Coker backed up first round pick E.J. Manuel in 2012 and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston in 2013, seeing limited time. He could not beat out veteran Blake Sims for the starting job once arriving in Tuscaloosa, though he did play a bit (38-59, 64.4 percent, 403 yards, four TD, no INT in 7 games).  But as Coker's first year as a starter progressed, there was improvement that NFL teams undoubtedly noticed. He won Offensive MVP honors in the Cotton Bowl win over Michigan State (25-30, 286 yards, two TD), which sent the Tide to the national title game against Clemson. Coker passed for a career-high 335 yards, connecting with tight end O.J. Howard for two scores, helping Alabama win its fourth title in seven years.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-coker/3200434f-4b42-8791-9dbf-0770bc634aa5
James Cowser,"One of the most productive players in the Football Championship Subdivision in 2014 (28.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks in 2014), Cowser used strong hands and a great motor to beat tackles again in his senior campaign (19 tackles for loss, 13 sacks, four forced fumbles). In fact, he set FCS records for career sacks (42.5) and tackles for loss (80) last season, his second straight season garnering All-American notice from the Walter Camp Foundation, the Associated Press, and other outlets. Cowser is a bit older than the typical draft prospect because he redshirted at SUU in 2009 before heading to a two-year LDS church mission. Combining that maturity with strength, intensity and production makes for an intriguing prospect.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-cowser/3200434f-5775-3938-83c4-94e7ef7d41b3
Joe Dahl,"After spending one year at the University of Montana and another sitting out as a transfer student, Dahl stepped into the starting lineup for the Cougars and hasn't left. He was the team‚Äôs left guard for the 2013 regular season before moving out to left tackle for the bowl game ‚Äì- his home for the past two seasons. It‚Äôs no surprise head coach/offensive mad genius Mike Leach can pass 50 times a game with minimal pressure given Dahl's ability to lock down the quarterback‚Äôs blind side with good lateral movement and a solid anchor. Despite earning first-team All-Pac-12 and USA Today second-team All-American accolades at left tackle in 2015, NFL scouts will want Dahl moved inside at the next level due to his average size and length. Either way, he‚Äôll be a worthy pick as a potential starter.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-dahl/32004441-4826-0173-4fe2-c531066eb9db
Sean Davis,"Davis speaks English, French, Chinese ... and the language of pain. At least that's what opposing ball carriers feel as he flies into them with reckless abandon. He was credited with more than 100 tackles in both his sophomore and junior seasons, and earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league media by making 88 tackles, intercepting three passes, and ranking among the FBS leaders in forced fumbles with five in 2015. His versatility will certainly be coveted by NFL scouts, as will his athleticism, height/length, and tenacious play.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-davis/32004441-5674-6549-b2ca-5398be67b2ce
Kenyan Drake,"Drake's explosiveness as an all-purpose weapon is somewhat tempered by his injury history. He suffered a broken leg against Ole Miss in 2014, and then fractured his right arm trying to make a tackle on special teams this fall. Drake did return a couple of weeks after that injury, however, and flashed his slashing style (averaged six yards a carry for his career). He also provides good hands out of the backfield (12.5 yards per reception). He showed in the national championship game he can be a threat as a kickoff returner, taking one back 95 yards for a crucial score. A healthy Drake could be a great find in the mid-to-late rounds.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenyan-drake/32004452-4128-0410-f1a5-770c8d09e9d7
Ka'imi Fairbairn,"Thankfully Fairbairn only goes by Ka'imi, because his full first name is a mouthful: Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a. Fairbairn was the first Bruin to total over 100 points in each of his four collegiate seasons, saving his best season for last. The 2015 Lou Groza Award winner connected on 20 of 24 attempts in 2015, improving from his 18-for-22 mark in 2014. Fairbairn made two of three attempts from 50 yards out or more, including a 60-yarder against Cal. His ability to force touchbacks on kickoffs also catches the eyes of scouts (119 of 164 in 2014-2015, or 72.6 percent). A dual threat like that is coveted by special teams coaches across the league, making this Hawaii native a wanted man.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ka-imi-fairbairn/32004641-4914-4264-2765-80ae068118ab
Kavon Frazier,"Frazier garnered second-team All-MAC recognition in his senior season (led team with 108 tackles, 4.5 for loss), but the largest honor he received was being able to wear the No. 21 jersey of his former friend and teammate, Derrick Nash. Nash passed away from leukemia in June 2015, and coaches decided to rotate the 21 jersey throughout the season as a way of honoring his memory. Frazier got to wear the jersey twice, including in the team's bowl game. Before 2015, Frazier played as a reserve in 2012 (36 tackles, one interception, three pass breakups), earned more playing time as a sophomore (67 tackles, three interceptions, five pass breakups), and went back to a partial starter in 2014 (58 stops, four pass break-ups).",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kavon-frazier/32004652-4177-7401-a536-f58bb866bebd
B.J. Goodson,"Like many players on major college football powers, Goodson rose up the ranks during his career, waiting for others to graduate or move on to the NFL before being able to show off his full skill set. He was no slouch coming from the same high school as former Clemson and NFL standout linebacker Levon Kirkland, though Goodson's game is not similar to that of his boyhood hero. After two years as a reserve (11 tackles in 2012-2013), Goodson became a co-starter at linebacker as a redshirt sophomore, making 34 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and three recovered fumbles. He took the reins of the defense in his senior season, leading the Tigers with 108 tackles, 14 of which resulted in losses including 5.5 sacks. Goodson displayed an excellent all-around game, intercepting two passes, breaking up three others, and forcing a fumble during the year to garner third-team All-ACC honors from league coaches (second-team from league media).",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/b-j-goodson/3200474f-4f56-8123-e385-55ab4e82d3d4
T.J. Green,"Green was a lightly-regarded two-star recruit out of Alabama when Clemson made a scholarship offer -- one of only two major programs to do so. Even though the other was his favorite school growing up, Auburn, he took a chance on Clemson, and it paid off well. He worked at the receiver position as a true freshman, catching two passes and returning three kicks in 12 games. Coaches moved him to safety after the season, with the hopes he could make a bigger impact -- figuratively and literally. As a sophomore he started once and played as a reserve in 10 other contests, recording 24 tackles and one interception, in addition to returning kicks full-time (445 yards). His game took a big leap in 2015, as Green and his roommate, Jayron Kearse, formed one of the tallest and most feared safety duos in the country. He finished second on the team with 95 tackles, 5.5 for loss, broke up three passes and forced two fumbles as the Tigers run at an undefeated season went all the way to the final game of the year.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-green/32004752-4536-3278-7659-b3833c7767bb
Deiondre' Hall,"Hall's head coach, Mark Farley, has stated that Hall could play any position on defense because of his good attitude, football intelligence, and tenacious nature. He started at safety as a freshman, played as a lean rover at times his sophomore year, and then moved to the outside later that year before starring at the position in 2014 (racking up 74 tackles and five picks). Farley and his defensive coaches moved Hall between corner and safety in 2015, and he saw success in both spots, earning multiple All-American honors and the Missouri Valley Football Conference Defensive Player of the Year award with 82 tackles, 5.5 for loss, and three forced fumbles. He also returned two of his league-best six interceptions for touchdowns, giving him a school-record four ""pick sixes"" in his career.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deiondre-hall/32004841-4c27-0555-d94b-8d6534cfaffd
Rashard Higgins,"A bit overshadowed playing in Fort Collins, Higgins was simply one of the most productive players in college football the past two seasons. The school's all-time leader in receptions (239), receiving yards (3,649) and receiving touchdowns (31). He actually had his worst season in 2015 with a new offense and a new quarterback (75-1,062, 8 TD) but was still a first team All-Mountain West selection. His 2014 season was phenomenal, garnering consensus All-American and first team all-conference honors with 96 catches (10th in the FBS) for a nation-leading 1,750 yards and 17 touchdowns. The Biletnikoff Award finalist's 17 touchdowns averaged 35 yards each. The honorable mention all-Texas pick became an immediate starter for the Rams in 2013, leading the team with 68 catches for 837 yards and six touchdowns.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashard-higgins/32004849-4732-2107-8b68-79212110bd89
Cardale Jones,"Jones went from relative unknown (outside Ohio) to superstar to backup during his tumultuous Buckeyes career. He signed with Ohio State a semester early after a stellar at career powerhouse Glenville (coached by Ted Ginn, Sr.), redshirted in 2012 and played just 39 plays from scrimmage in 2013 (1-3 passing, 17-128, one TD rushing). But when Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett were lost to injury before and during the 2015 season, respectively, it was Jones‚Äô turn to shine. He came in for Barrett to finish off Michigan, beat down Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then led the Buckeyes to a national title a month later.  Jones finished the year completing 60.0 percent of his throws for 860 yards and seven touchdowns against two interceptions, as well as rushing for 296 yards and a score. Head Coach Urban Meyer named Jones the starter after a heated battle between he and Barrett, but Jones‚Äô inconsistency caused him to lose the job to Barrett halfway through the season (eight starts, 1,460 passing yards, 62.5 percent on completions, eight TD, five INT; 193 yards, two TD rushing). With Barrett returning for another year in 2016, Jones decided to enter the NFL draft as an early entrant rather than finishing his career at another college.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cardale-jones/32004a4f-4e14-8555-d9b4-033152b27716
Cyrus Jones,"Jones switched from receiver to cornerback for his sophomore campaign in 2013, and then blossomed into a second-team All-SEC pick by league media in 2014 (three interceptions, 13 pass deflections) in spite of a torn labrum in his hip, which was surgically repaired in the offseason. He started all 15 games his senior year, improving in coverage (two INT, seven PBU) and putting to rest concerns about his hip. Teams might be more interested in him as a punt returner, though, as his four touchdowns on a nation-leading 42 attempts in 2015 (12.6 yard average) came up one short of tying the FBS record. A domestic violence charge that was dropped against him last spring will make teams take a hard look at his character references.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cyrus-jones/32004a4f-4e18-8523-7c89-f25eabe340bc
Drew Kaser,"Nearly every year, at least one punter hears his name called in the top 200 picks; it could be Kaser in 2016 because he possesses a quick delivery as well as the leg strength and hang time to consistently change field position. He was an All-American and Ray Guy Award finalist in 2013 after leading the SEC with a 47.4-yard average (beating perennial Pro Bowler Shane Lechler's school record), and had nice follow-up seasons in 2014 (44.5-yard average, 19-of-56 punts inside the 20). Kaser broke that school record again in 2015 (47.47) on his way to first team All-SEC honors, placing 21 of 60 punts inside the 20-yard line. He also threatened the SEC career record with a 46.2 career gross average.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/drew-kaser/32004b41-5304-3714-c553-9ab1828de953
Jayron Kearse,"Clemson may have locked up Kearse as a recruit by giving him the choice of playing safety or receiver once arriving on campus. Not only did he prefer the physical aspects of the game in spite of his frame, but he also has some excellent family resources to access on the defensive side of the ball; his uncle is former Florida and NFL pass rusher extraordinaire Jevon Kearse and cousin is former Miami and NFL star cornerback Phillip Buchanon. He started just three games in his freshman season, playing in 12, but still managed to make 55 tackles and tie for the team lead with four interceptions. Kearse started at safety his sophomore campaign (67 stops, five for loss, three sacks, two interceptions) and continued that success in a first-team All-ACC junior season (62 tackles, 6.5 for loss, one interception, six pass break-ups). The Associated Press voted him second team All-American in 2015, as well, as he joined a bevy of talented defenders and Heisman hopeful quarterback Deshaun Watson in putting together an undefeated regular season and national championship game appearance.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jayron-kearse/32004b45-4150-8861-f410-98e938396142
Cody Kessler,"Physically, there's nothing special about Kessler; he possesses average size, an adequate arm, and fair athleticism (though he can effectively move within the pocket, which is important). The three-year starter could never crack Pac-12 first or second all-conference teams from league coaches, thrice finishing in the honorable mention category. However, Kessler was a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award the past two years because he moves the offense efficiently (3,826 yards, completed 69.7 percent of his passes; 3,536, 66.8 percent in 2015) and doesn‚Äôt turn the ball over much (39 touchdowns, five interceptions in 2014; 29 TD, 7 INT in 2015). In fact, Kessler owns the school record for career completion percentage at 67.5.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-kessler/32004b45-5370-1662-8570-5095ed4b0b10
Darius Latham,"Latham is a product of Indianapolis' North Central High School, where he starred as a football and basketball player, and decided to sign on with his home state team despite being a top 20 defensive tackle recruit nationally. The team made room for their prized recruit on the field immediately, as he played in all 12 games as a regular in the rotation (22 tackles, three for loss, two sacks, three pass break-ups). Latham made some plays in his sophomore year (10 starts, 26 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks) but turned up his game a bit in his junior year. He garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors after making 33 tackles, 10 for loss, and four sacks during 2015. However, NFL scouts evaluating the early entrant will take heed that Latham was twice suspended for one game due to violating team rules.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darius-latham/32004c41-5404-2617-523c-acfec83be9f7
Kenny Lawler,"Lawler and quarterback Jared Goff made a great combination for Cal, helping the Bears increase their win total from one to eight over the past three seasons. As a redshirt freshman, tied for the team lead with five touchdown catches among his 37 receptions for 347 yards. Goff and Lawler left for the NFL after a strong 2015 season for both, with Lawler voted a first-team All-Pac-12 pick with 52 catches, 658 yards, and 13 touchdowns (ranking in the top ten nationally). He finished his Cal career with three touchdowns against Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-lawler/32004c41-5715-1948-de02-fb0304f79711
Jay Lee,"A size-speed prospect, Lee's ability to stretch the field has worked perfectly in Art Briles' prolific Baylor offense. He stepped up his game as a junior, catching 41 passes for 633 yards and six touchdowns and even throwing a 53-yard touchdown pass to Corey Coleman in the Cotton Bowl against Michigan State. Lee became an even bigger part of the Bears‚Äô nation-leading offense in 2015, averaging nearly 20 yards per catch using his striding speed and scoring eight touchdowns. Lee was a nice foil to Coleman this fall, a role he'll likely play at the next level.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jay-lee/32004c45-4538-2497-1f3b-15e9063c8859
Jalin Marshall,"As a five-star recruit set to play in his home state, Marshall faced high expectations from Buckeyes fans. His transition from spectacular dual-threat quarterback to wide receiver was not immediate, however, as he redshirted the 2013 season due to injuries (including a concussion). He then tore a meniscus in spring practice, slowing his development a bit more. The payoff came in the team's national championship season of 2014, as he played in all 15 games as a reserve and was the team's second-leading receiver with 38 catches for 499 yards and six scores. Those freshman-year numbers, which were second only to Hall of Fame receiver Cris Carter in OSU's storied history, gained him Freshman All-American accolades. Marshall was also second on the team in receiving in 2015 and receiving honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a receiver (36-477, five TD) and punt returner (28-379), before deciding to head to the next level.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalin-marshall/32004d41-5241-7066-3341-107c573a047d
Connor McGovern,"One of the strongest players in college football, McGovern has broken weight room records at Mizzou (like a 690-pound squat) and actually tore his pectoral muscle trying to bench 515 pounds. The Gatorade High School Player of the Year in North Dakota in 2010, McGovern's not just all muscle. He's started for three years at right guard, right tackle, and then left tackle as a senior. Though McGovern was solid for the Tigers at tackle, scouts consider him a better interior prospect due to that strength and his underrated movement skills. He hopes to move up boards throughout the process, just like his teammate, Mitch Morse, who was picked in the mid-second round by Kansas City in the 2015 draft.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/connor-mcgovern/32004d43-4752-6326-78aa-3927e53a565c
Jalen Mills,"In August, Mills fractured his left fibula (leg) and tore ligaments in his ankle. So he took a redshirt year, right? Wrong. He came back to play in six games, starting the final five at nickelback or safety (30 tackles, sack, three pass breakups). Mills' toughness wasn‚Äôt surprising given his strength as a tackler (62 stops in 2014) and the hands to create turnovers consistently (six interceptions in his first three years). LSU is known for the talent in their secondary, but that didn't stop Mills from starting at cornerback as a true freshman (57 tackles, two INT, five PBU) after Tyrann Mathieu was dismissed from the team.  Though scouts will love his versatility, they have questions about an arrest for second-degree battery of a woman in the summer of 2014 (the charges were eventually reduced to a misdemeanor and he was assigned to a diversion program).",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-mills/32004d49-4c68-8675-144f-40ee3d9b3d2b
Antonio Morrison,"This two-time second-team All-SEC pick is undersized, but extremely productive; he hit triple digits in tackles in 2014 (101) and 2015 (103, leading the team), and doubled his impact in the backfield between those two seasons, going from six to 12 tackles for loss. The fact he played at all this fall was a tribute to his work ethic, as he came back from undergoing multiple surgeries on his left knee to repair an injury from the 2014 Birmingham Bowl. However, teams will have to check into his background due to two arrests (punching bouncer, barking at a police dog/resisting arrest) within five weeks in the summer of 2013. If he can convince general managers that his hard times are behind him, they'll bank on his talent.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antonio-morrison/32004d4f-5256-4646-be3d-82ef348fa3d1
Yannick Ngakoue,"Born in Washington, D.C., Ngakoue stayed nearby for college after an excellent high school career. He was named the D.C. Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior, racking up 17 sacks and leading Friendship Collegiate to a district title. Nkagoue got his feet wet as a true freshman, making 10 tackles, 4.5 for loss including two sacks, and an interception playing every game as a reserve. His play as a sophomore earned honorable mention notice from league media (37 tackles, 13.5 for loss and six sacks) and portended better things to come. Quarterbacks in the Big Ten did not appreciate his improvement in what proved to be his final collegiate season -- he set a Maryland record and finished tied for second in the country with 13.5 sacks (within 15 total tackles for loss).",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/yannick-ngakoue/32004e47-4135-5963-d006-ceac3beca035
Jared Norris,"Norris hopes to be the next Ute end/linebacker to enter the NFL (recent draftees include Joe and Paul Kruger, Koa Misi, Nate Orchard and Trevor Reilly). He played as a reserve as a redshirt freshman before starting seven games the following year (64 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks). Norris came into his own as a junior, receiving honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors  with 116 tackles, 13 for loss, and four sacks. Even though his statistics weren't as impressive in 2015 (87 tackles, 6.5 for loss, one sack), league coaches named him second team all-conference because he showed stoutness between the tackles and a burst to the ball which portends a solid NFL career.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jared-norris/32004e4f-5246-3803-78bf-94a310f292cb
Joshua Perry,"Perry gained respect from Big Ten coaches for his play as a senior, garnering first team All-Big Ten notice with 105 tackles, 7.5 for loss and three sacks. He also received honors for his leadership and character, being named an all-state AFCA All-Good Works Team member, as well as a finalist for the Lott IMPACT, Senior CLASS Award, and the Wuerffel Trophy. The Buckeyes' leading tackler in 2014 (124, 8.5 for loss, three sacks) earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors in his second year as a starter (he had 64 tackles, two for loss the previous year).

Tyvis Powell,"Powell just seems to make big plays in big games. He intercepted Michigan's two-point attempt to win the rivalry game as a redshirt freshman in 2013, He picked off a Hail Mary attempt by Alabama in the 2014 college football semifinal, ensuring the Buckeyes could go on to win the championship ‚Äì where he won Defensive MVP honors against Oregon (game-high nine tackles, pass break-up). Then he intercepted yet another pass in Ohio State‚Äôs win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. After that contest, Powell (who graduated in three and a half years) decided to take his game to the NFL.  He played in all 14 games in that redshirt freshman season, starting five times (48 tackles, one interception). Earning the full-time starter spot in 2014, Powell made 76 tackles, two for loss, while intercepting four passes and breaking up four others. His play as a junior merited honorable mention All-Big Ten honors from coaches and media, as he led the Buckeyes with three interceptions and made 71 tackles on the year.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyvis-powell/3200504f-5756-9823-1fcd-d472a5c902f4
Dak Prescott,"Rayne Dakota ""Dak"" Prescott proved himself to be an excellent college quarterback in 2014, breaking all sorts of school records (4,435 yards of total offense, 27 touchdown passes, 61.6 completion percentage), named a finalist for the Maxwell, Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Unitas Golden Arm awards and helping his team to a 10-3 record. The two-time first team All-SEC pick ended up with 38 MSU records after a senior year where he won the Senior CLASS Award as the top scholar-athlete on and off the field. Prescott led the team in passing (3,793 yards, 66.2 completion percentage, 29 TD, five INT) and rushing (588 yards, 10 scores) for the second straight year in 2015, joining Tim Tebow as the only two players in SEC history to accomplish that feat. Prescott got on the radar as a redshirt freshman in 2012, playing as a red-zone quarterback, scoring four times as a passer and four as a runner. The next year, he started seven games in two-quarterback system (Tyler Russell), throwing with 1,940 yards, and 10 touchdowns (seven INT), missing two games with an elbow injury.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dak-prescott/32005052-4528-5723-d1b2-96e92ebc1241
Beau Sandland,"This California native didn't get much play as a high school recruit, so he stayed in-state to play at two-year Pierce College. By the time he was wrapping up an all-conference season at Pierce (24-267, three TD), schools from all over the country were interested in his services. He chose to fly across the country to Miami, Florida, to follow in the footsteps of many top-rated tight ends. But after one season (9-94 receiving in 13 games), Sandland decided he would rather attend a school closer to his home environment. He sat out the 2014 season transferring to FCS program Montana State. With a year in the offense under his belt, Sandland's game took off in 2015, as he earned All-American honors from the Associated Press and first-team All-Big Sky notice with 37 catches for 632 yards and nine scores.  Even with just one good season at the junior college level and another for a FCS team, NFL scouts are intrigued enough with his skill set to make sure he was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/beau-sandland/32005341-4e58-4247-68f8-ec6da1f1170c
Joe Schobert,"Wisconsin has a storied walk-on tradition, producing NFL players like J.J. Watt and Jim Leonhard; Schobert hopes to be the next non-scholarship signee to jump to the NFL. He nearly began his career at North Dakota as a walk-on, but the Badger coaches wised up to offer him a spot on the team. Schobert's role grew each season, from reserve as a true freshman to key reserve (24 tackles, one start) in 2013 to consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten pick (13.5 tackles for loss) in his junior year. His draft stock rose to new heights in 2015, as he was named second-team All-American by USA Today and the Associated Press, as well as the Big Ten Linebacker of the Year and first-team All-Conference.

Isaac Seumalo,"It's a family affair at Oregon State for the Seumalos. Isaac's brother, Andrew, was a captain at defensive tackle for the Beavers and was a graduate assistant coach. His father, Joe, was the defensive line coach (but has since moved on to BYU), and his sister, Jessi, plays volleyball in Corvallis. Isaac was the most highly recruited of any of them, rated as a top five guard prospect nationally out of high school. It was no surprise, therefore, that he suited up in the middle as a true freshman, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors and multiple Freshman All-American nods. He showed versatility in 2013, garnering second team All-Pac-12 recognition for starting 10 games at center and two at right tackle due to injuries at that position. Unfortunately, Seumalo suffered a broken foot in the 2013 Hawai'i Bowl, which needed multiple surgeries to correct. He missed the entire 2014 season, although he still was named a team captain. Finishing off his career, Seumalo started all 12 games in 2015, nine at right guard, three at left tackle, meaning that he has started in four of the five spots on the line.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaac-seumalo/32005345-5530-6003-d964-c18cd95b904b
Hunter Sharp,"A cousin of Kansas City Chiefs star linebacker Derrick Johnson, it's no surprise that Sharp shows Sunday-type athleticism. After excelling at the junior college level for two years, the California native put on a show for the Aggies the past two years. Sharp garnered honorable mention All-Mountain West honors in 2014, using strong hands and excellent quickness to snatch 66 balls out of the air for 939 yards and seven scores, four of which were longer than 70 yards (most in the nation).

The two-time first-team All-MAC pick caught 85 passes for 1,281 yards and seven touchdowns in his junior year, setting up big expectations for 2015. He exceeded those expectations, winning second team All-American honors from the Walter Camp Foundation by leading the nation with 9.3 receptions per game (total of 111) and ranking sixth in yards per game (109.9-yard average).

He might have to wait a while before keeping a whistle around his neck, however, because of his length and versatility. Simmons started off his collegiate career strong, starting seven games as a true freshman (six at free safety, one at cornerback), making 52 tackles, one interception, and four pass breakups. He stepped back a bit as a sophomore (no starts, 34 tackles, three pass break-ups), but got back into the groove in 2014, starting all 13 games, the first six at free safety, final six at cornerback due to injuries at the position.

The corner came from Andre Agassi Prep in Nevada, which was a eight-man football program when he was a freshman. Sims was a third-team All-Big Sky Conference selection as a junior, and has used his size and tenacious nature to intercept six passes and break up 15 others in his first three years. He projects as a press corner at the next level, and will get a chance to show scouts at a postseason all-star game whether he has the speed and change of direction ability to stay in the hop pocket of NFL receivers.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leshaun-sims/32005349-4d76-7909-9084-6fd680c177bd

Nelson Spruce,"One of the most productive receivers in college football in 2014, Spruce filled the stats sheet with 105 catches for nearly 1,200 yards and 12 scores. His senior year, however, was not as productive (84-942, three TD) partially due to the team's offensive limitations. While Spruce is not considered an explosive downfield threat, he runs solid routes, fights for the ball in the air and is a reliable pass-catcher (he's the Pac-12's leader in career receptions) -- three important traits for a No. 2 or 3 NFL receiver.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nelson-spruce/32005350-5277-0940-e1be-3589f1cda575

An NFL team will find room for Striker because of his explosiveness to the ball; ironically, he grew up in Tampa watching a Buccaneers defense that would have valued his speed and tenacity despite his size. He garnered first-team All-Big 12 and Associated Press All-American notice as both a junior (third team) and senior (second team). In his three years as a starter, Striker lived in opponents‚Äô backfields, racking up 46.5 tackles for loss and 23 sacks, while also hustling in coverage to defend 12 passes.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-striker/32005354-5244-1079-4dc7-ae4a1d139448

The 2012 Lou Groza High School Player of the Year joined his father in winning the award, becoming the first family duo to do so. Taylor showed glimpses of that talent in a Freshman All-SEC season in 2013 (508 rush yards, four TD) and a sophomore season without a ton of opportunities (565 yards, six TD on 116 carries). He finally became ""the man"" for the Gators, getting 259 totes and covering 1,035 yards and scoring 13 times while also catching 17 passes for 150 yards.

In his first year with the Razorbacks, he used a strong base and brute strength to pave the way for two 1,000-yard rushers in Alex Collins and Jonathan Williams.

Aaron Wallace,"Wallace didn't get to experience a lot of his father's professional career, as the former Oakland Raiders' second-round pick left his job as an NFL linebacker when his son was only five years old. However, the younger Aaron obviously carries the family athleticism genes -- though he didn't really get to show his wares until his senior year with the Bruins. His senior year of high school was disappointing, as he couldn‚Äôt play  due to torn ankle ligaments. After a redshirt year at UCLA, he played in 23 games as a reserve in 2012 and 2013, totaling eight tackles. Wallace saw the field a bit more regularly as a junior, starting one contest and making 19 tackles. He didn't earn a starting job coming out of fall camp in 2015, but injuries in the linebacker corps gave him a chance, and he took advantage.

The NCAA waived the typical transfer season due to his circumstances, allowing Wallace to garner second team All-Mountain West accolades in his first year as a starter. He tied for seventh nationally with 14 pass breakups that season to go along with 26 tackles and one interception.

However, a sprained MCL suffered late in the year and suspension for breaking team rules pushed Williams to return to school for the 2015 season. Then Williams reportedly assaulted multiple people while intoxicated in an Auburn club, and was dismissed from the team forthwith (though no one filed charges against Williams, who wasn't named in the police report.) Before the incident, Williams‚Äô production hadn't been great (12 catches, 147 yards, one score in five games.)

Worley had led the team the previous year with three interceptions (also with 52 tackles, 4.5 for loss, four breakups), but faced trouble during the season. He was accused of assaulting a woman outside a nightclub in September, eventually pled no contest and received a six-month suspended sentence for his actions, which he said were in defense of his girlfriend. Worley missed two games due to a suspension. As a true freshman, Worley made his presence known on defense and special teams, starting five games, making 45 tackles, intercepting one pass, and breaking up five others.",5.9,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daryl-worley/3200574f-5261-6410-d895-940efbad622c
Austin Blythe,"In the sports world, Iowa is primarily known for two things: producing NFL offensive linemen and high-level wrestling. Blythe, a Williamsburg, Iowa native, is a perfect example of how those things go hand-in-hand. He was a two-time all-state pick in football (123 career tackles, 40 for loss, 14 sacks) and three straight heavyweight wresting titles (setting a state record with 143 pins) in a state that takes the sport very seriously. He put those skills to use in his redshirt freshman season, starting nine games at right guard but missing two due to injury. Blythe didn‚Äôt miss any more games during his three final years with the Hawkeyes, starting all 40 games at center. He gained recognition for his play each year, garnering consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a sophomore and second team All-Big Ten accolades from league coaches in 2014 and 2015. Blythe was even named as a Rimington Trophy finalist this season.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-blythe/3200424c-5961-1687-a06c-7345068b7e5f
Ben Braunecker,"The last four players drafted from Harvard enjoyed at least some NFL success, from long-time starting center Matt Birk to special teams ace Isaiah Kacyvenski to veteran starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to the Ravens versatile fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Braunecker (and his teammate, offensive tackle Cole Toner) could be next on the draft list after an All-American (AP, Walter Camp, AFCA) senior season with the Crimson. The first team All-Ivy League selection caught 48 passes for 850 yards and eight touchdowns (including four 100-yard games in the last six weeks), easily outdistancing his production as a sophomore (9-91, one touchdown) and junior (11-227, one touchdown).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-braunecker/32004252-4169-2421-3070-8ac2a448d892
Beniquez Brown,"Instead of playing for a third linebackers coach in five seasons, Brown followed the lead of former teammate and 2015 second-round pick Bernardrick McKinney to enter the NFL draft after his junior season. Brown didn't garner the accolades that McKinney did during his career with the Bulldogs, failing to make a coaches or media all-conference squad over the past three years. However, there is little question of his football acumen. He started the final three games of his redshirt freshman season, recording 39 tackles, 4.5 for loss in 13 games. Brown made plays as a starting outside linebacker in 2014, ranking second on the team with 62 tackles, seven for loss, and two interceptions. In 2015, NFL scouts started really noticing Brown's play on the outside as he racked up 99 tackles and blocked two kicks, including a potential game-winner by Arkansas in the game's final seconds. He ended his career on a sharp note, making nine stops, two for loss, against North Carolina State in the Belk Bowl.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/beniquez-brown/32004252-4f26-8591-e888-3fc759cd93ab
Deon Bush,"The 'Canes haven't had a safety drafted since Brandon Meriweather and Kenny Phillips went in the first round in 2007 and 2008, respectively. That will change in 2016, with Bush offering range and intimidating hits in the back of the secondary. The Miami native and 2015 honorable mention All-ACC honoree could join the aforementioned ""U"" talents as NFL players because he can separate the ball from its previous owner (five forced fumbles in 2014), attack the line of scrimmage (103 tackles in 2014-2015, seven for losses), and make plays on the ball in deep coverage (four interceptions, 13 pass breakups in his career). NFL teams will also like his character. The American Football Coaches Association put him on their All-Good Works team this season, and he donated his per diem money from the Independence Bowl for Christmas gifts for homeless children.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deon-bush/32004255-5321-6856-7188-bf3ce3fe93af
Kevin Byard,"Although Byard looks and plays (312 career tackles) like a strong safety, he often finds himself in the back half of the secondary guarding the prize for the Blue Raiders. He‚Äôs at the top of the active player career interception list with 19, scoring on four of them in his first two years on campus, and has broken up 17 passes during that time. A four-time all-conference pick, Byard was a second-team All-Sun Belt pick (and FWAA Freshman All-American) in 2012 before garnering honorable mention All-Conference USA notice in 2013 and first team accolades in C-USA the past two seasons.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-byard/32004259-4125-1361-f4be-db294c8d9a0f
De'Vondre Campbell,"Wiry and strong, Campbell is just scratching the surface of his potential. Though you'd expect a linebacker of that size to be purely a pass rusher, the Hutchinson Community College transfer moves better than expected in the open field. After a solid sophomore (three starts in 13 games played, 41 tackles, three for loss) season for the Gophers, he earned a starting role as a junior (75 tackles, 6.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks). Campbell lived up to his billing in 2015, named by Big Ten coaches and media honorable mention all-conference as he made 92 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and a team-high four sacks.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/de-vondre-campbell/32004341-4d22-7922-fbee-a8af685282e3
Maurice Canady,"There's a lot to like about Virginia's next cornerback prospect: He's tall (listed at 6-foot-2), has long arms to knock away passes from receivers (18 pass breakups in 2014-2015), and flashes hands to snatch low or high errant passes (three interceptions as a junior). He also has returned punts for scores during his career, including one for a 74-yard score against William and Mary this fall. If scouts believe Canady can wrap up ball carriers and get them to the ground, he'll move up draft boards like former tall Cavs corners Ras-I Dowling and Chris Cook did before him.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/maurice-canady/32004341-4e14-9679-82f3-30242a8781d3
Leonte Carroo,"Despite the fact he was losing his quarterback of eight years in Gary Nova (they played together at Don Bosco Prep, as well) for his senior year, Carroo decided to stay in college for one more year. The honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2014 (1,068 receiving yards, 19.7 yards per catch, 10 touchdowns) didn‚Äôt have quite as much success as a senior (39-809, 10 touchdowns), mostly because a high-ankle sprain and suspension for an assault arrest (the charges for which were dropped by the female victim) kept Carroo from maximizing his productivity. Despite these issues, he earned third-team All-Big Ten accolades from league media due to his playmaking ability.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leonte-carroo/32004341-5255-9411-d434-c76ad52fee92
Tra Carson,"Carson is a load with just enough speed to make linebackers regret leaving a gap for him to run through. The transfer from Oregon (after only one season) started just four games in 2014, but still led the team with 581 rushing yards. His Offensive MVP performance in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl (133 yards) portended his strong senior campaign which saw him cover 1,165 yards and score seven times on the ground as well as contribute regularly in the passing game (29-183, one TD).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tra-carson/32004341-5259-4837-927b-ca787fe79a45
Kyle Carter,"Carter's numbers haven't matched his physical characteristics during his career at Penn State, though it may be interesting to see if his utilization improves in a pro setting. He came out of the blocks strong as a redshirt freshman, earning Freshman All-American honors with 36 receptions covering 453 yards and two scores before a wrist injury sidelined him. As a sophomore, he caught just 18 passes for 222 yards and a touchdown (a game-winner against Illinois in overtime). Carter ended his junior year with a bang, catching a touchdown to tie up the Pinstripe Bowl versus Boston College, allowing for the extra point to win the game. That was his only score for the year, however, on 16 catches for 153 yards. During his senior year, he fought an ankle injury that limited his effectiveness (14 catches, 135 yards).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-carter/32004341-5268-7523-6d30-f9b88e143bc8
Marshaun Coprich,"Few running backs in college football history have been as productive as Coprich, who cleared 5,200 rushing yards in his four years at ISU. His senior season almost didn‚Äôt happen, though, because he was caught trying to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer. His indefinite suspension from the football program was lifted after agreeing to a first-time offender program and community service. Once back on the field, Coprich took full advantage, totaling 1,967 rushing yards on a hefty 321 carries and scoring 23 times. As if he hadn't seen the ball enough, the Walter Payton Award finalist also caught 18 passes for 179 yards and a score.  This was actually the second time Coprich had earned multiple All-American honors (AP, Walter Camp, AFCA, etc) for his talents, as he ran for a FCS-best 2,274 yards on 370 carries the previous year. Reaching the 2,000-yard mark was no new thing for the California native, as he covered 2,269 yards and scored 29 times as a senior in high school.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marshaun-coprich/3200434f-5077-3056-f07f-afc9d31489fc
K.J. Dillon,"Dillon stepped up his game in his senior year after teammate Karl Joseph went down to injury. He finished with 55 tackles, 7.5 for loss, two interceptions and eight pass break-ups, garnering second team All-Big 12 accolades. Dillon went through the typical ascension through his career in Morgantown, playing on special teams and as a reserve safety as a true freshman (20 tackles, forced fumble) before becoming a part-time starter in 2013 (28 tackles, three for loss, team-leading six pass breakups). He only played in nine games that year, however, because a case of severe dehydration suffered in November landed him first in the hospital and then on the sideline for the remainder of the season. Dillon came back with a vengeance as a junior, though, starting 12 games, making 62 tackles, and tying for the team lead with three interceptions and seven pass breakups.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/k-j-dillon/32004449-4c28-1141-b51d-24a0fc2ae2a7
Spencer Drango,"A four-year starter, there's no questioning Drango's intensity or strength at the line of scrimmage. The 2014 consensus and 2015 unanimous All-American and first-team all-conference pick has the size and strength to lock onto defensive ends, but still has the mobility to pull inside to lead for a rushing attack that ranks in the top three in the country in rushing yards, including an astounding 645 against North Carolina in the Russell Athletic Bowl.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/spencer-drango/32004452-4147-2970-23af-edda5c84dfc1
Jason Fanaika,"This strong-side defensive end has played for both Utah State and Utah during his career, playing two seasons with the Aggies and then going on a church mission in Indianapolis before moving on to Salt Lake City. Fanaika (fan-NA-ee-ka) has been a high-motor producer for the Utes the past two years, starting eight games (9.5 tackles for loss, five sacks) in 2014 and then honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors as a senior (10.5 tackles for loss, four sacks).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jason-fanaika/32004641-4e00-8327-7157-5ea8c5fdffbf
Josh Ferguson,"Ferguson never had a 1,000-rushing yard season in his career, but he's been invaluable to Illinois' offense when given the chance. He produced more than 1,000 yards of total offense in 2013 and 2014, including 1,162 as a junior (735 rushing, 427 receiving on 50 receptions), and scored 21 total touchdowns in 2013-2014. Ferguson missed three games with a shoulder injury as a senior, but still nearly reached four digits of rushing-receiving yards (988 total, five TD). Ferguson isn't the biggest back in the draft class, but his explosiveness and elusiveness are perfect for teams looking for a dual threat in the backfield.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-ferguson/32004645-5220-1072-f1b2-93256fd73752
Josh Forrest,"Although Forrest didn't play football until his junior year of high school, he did enough there (14 touchdowns receiving, seven interceptions -- three returned for touchdowns) to earn a scholarship from the Wildcats. After two years as a reserve, Forrest took over as a starter, leading the team in tackles in each of the past two seasons (110 in 2014, 93 in 2015). He also made plays in the passing game, intercepting two passes each year (including a 81-yard pick six against Louisville this year).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-forrest/3200464f-5249-6380-9676-0b98d557ad98
Joe Haeg,"Every draft since 2010 has seen at least one offensive lineman from a non-FBS school drafted in the top 100. Haeg is this year's best candidate, as the 2014 (AP, AFCA) and 2015 (AP, Walter Camp) All-American hopes to follow in his former teammate's shoes; tackle Billy Turner was drafted in the third round by Miami in 2014. This former walk-on received the Top Collegiate Offensive Lineman award from the FCS Athletic Directors Association in 2015, as well. Haeg, a two-time first team All-Missouri Valley Conference pick, started 60 of a possible 61 games (29 at right tackle, 32 on the left side after Turner went to the NFL).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-haeg/32004841-4522-3809-a626-bd41b8c38c63
Javon Hargrave,"Typically, 300-pound defensive tackles are not among the nation's leaders in sacks -- even at the FCS level. But the 2014 and 2015 Associated Press All-American and MEAC Defensive Player of the Year in 2014 ranked third in the FCS with 16 as a junior -- a whopping six against Bethune-Cookman, a figure that tied the FCS single-game record -- and 13.5 more this fall. He also had 45.5 tackles for loss over those two seasons. His size and brute strength overwhelmed his competition throughout his career, even racking up good numbers in his FCS Freshman All-American (45 tackles, 4.5 for loss) and sophomore (12.5 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javon-hargrave/32004841-5214-3881-f71a-319de907d4f9
Dominick Jackson,"Jackson was one of the top junior college players in the country at the College of San Mateo in 2013, dominating his competition at the guard position on an every-play basis. Although he played as a reserve in first year with Alabama, he made the field as a blocking back in goal-line situations because of his athleticism and willingness to take on defenders in the hole. Jackson's run blocking as the Tide‚Äôs starting right tackle in 2015 lived up to the hype, and he was solid enough in pass protection as well to be named second-team All-SEC. Jackson's versatility will be valued by NFL scouts.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dominick-jackson/32004a41-4313-3807-b537-34c0e91416e0
Cory Johnson,"Johnson signed with Temple coming out of high school, but decided to follow the junior college path instead. He starred at tiny ASA College in Brooklyn, New York, earning All-Conference notice for his 15 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks as a sophomore. Johnson signed with Kentucky instead of Miami or Texas Tech, and his game proved SEC-worthy. He played as a reserve in 2014 (10 tackles, four for loss, 2.5 sacks) before taking a starting role last season (67 stops, eight for loss, two sacks). One of the highlights of the 2015 college football season was watching Johnson return a fumble 77 yards for a score.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cory-johnson/32004a4f-4814-1308-78ad-a6aa6d2ee990
Devon Johnson,"It's not tough to see why ""Rockhead"" earned that moniker -- no one wants to get in the way of this 6-1, 243-pound freight train when he's healthy. The 2014 first-team All-Conference USA pick accumulated 1,767 yards and 17 touchdowns rushing as a junior after lining up for two years as a tight end. His receiving skills (12 catches, 218 yards, two scores in 2013) actually give him a chance to take on an H-back role. Unfortunately, Johnson could only play seven games (five starts) in 2015 due to a back injury (593 rush yards, five TD). So he'll need to prove his health before proving he can play on Sundays.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devon-johnson/32004a4f-4820-2338-142d-471908ecfdf1
Jonathan Jones,"Although some NFL teams won't draft a cornerback under 5-10 because of the height and speed of today's star receivers, Jones' athleticism (110-meter hurdles national high school champion) and play the past two seasons will certainly make someone take a chance on his talent. He earned second-team All-SEC notice as a junior, ranking among the nation's leaders with six interceptions and 17 passes defended in his first year as a starter for the Tigers. He might have received the nod in 2013, but suffered a broken bone before the season and wasn‚Äôt quite up to the challenge physically. Jones started all 13 games as a senior, though, making 69 stops, intercepting one pass, and breaking up 13 others.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-jones/32004a4f-4e49-5280-4eed-171301d538b0

He won the Gene Upshaw Trophy as Division II's top lineman and was named the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference's (GLIAC) Defensive Lineman of the Year and Associated Press Little All-American squad. He led all of college football with 20 sacks among his 23.5 tackles for loss, made 81 total tackles and forced three fumbles. Judon showed promise beating D2 tackles off the edge with length and speed as a junior, as well, winning first team All-GLIAC honors with 19 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles. All of this success came after losing four games in the middle of the 2012 season (seven TFL, 3.5 sacks) and all but the first seven plays of the 2013 season with injuries.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-judon/32004a55-4444-2977-278b-6fd440b8c2e8
Ufomba Kamalu,"Kamalu came to the United States as a freshman in high school without a mastery of the English language, so he lacked real recruiting hype because of his issues trying to succeed academically. Once given the opportunity to play at Butler Community College in 2012, however, he proved athletic and strong enough (54 tackles, 7.5 sacks, three forced fumbles) to get a chance at major college football. Kamalu saw the field a fair amount in his first two years in Coral Gables, playing nine games in 2013 (13 tackles, 3.5 sacks) and then starting two of 13 games played as a junior (34 stops, 3.5 sacks). Miami coaches stuck him in the starting lineup nine times in 2015, watching him rack up 47 tackles, four for loss, and one interception.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ufomba-kamalu/32004b41-4d10-5154-e477-a74a279076a9
Henry Krieger-Coble,"Krieger-Coble and his first cousin, George Kittle (their mothers were sisters), formed a solid one-two punch at tight end for the Hawkeyes in their successful 2015 campaign. Krieger-Coble had to wait until this senior year, though, to break through for head coach Kirk Ferentz. He started one game in his redshirt freshman year (in a two-TE set), catching four passes for 30 yards and a touchdown. As a sophomore, he caught no passes despite playing in all 13 games. Krieger-Coble earned three starts in his junior year, catching three passes for 28 yards and two scores, but missed the final three games due to a shoulder injury.

Nile Lawrence-Stample,"Lawrence-Stample is a run-stuffer, pure and simple. The nose tackle eats double teams for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If single-blocked, however, Lawrence-Stample can find the ball and has the short-area quickness to make the play, so NFL teams looking for a pure nose tackle could be interested. A pectoral injury limited him to four games in 2014, although he came back for the team's Rose Bowl appearance against Oregon (blocking an extra point). A healthy 2015 season, where he played in all 13 games and earned first-team All-ACC honors (36 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks), gave NFL scouts something to consider when reviewing interior defenders.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nile-lawrence-stample/32004c41-5752-1908-fb05-cf17a980fe01
Steve Longa,"Growing up in Cameroon, Longa's first love was world football. But upon reaching the U.S., he gave American football a try. By the time he left Saddle Brook High, he was a prized recruit. Four years later, he's among the best linebackers in the country. As a redshirt freshman, Longa started all 13 games at middle linebacker for the Scarlet Knights, sharing the team's Defensive MVP honors (123 tackles, 7.5 for loss, three sacks, two forced fumbles, four pass break-ups). He moved to the weak side in 2014, once again leading Rutgers with 102 tackles (4.5 for loss, two sacks) and stayed at that position for an honorable mention All-Big Ten junior season (117 tackles, five for loss, two sacks).

Dean Lowry,"The Chicago Tribune All-State pick decided to stay in-state to play for a Wildcats legend in head coach Pat Fitzgerald at Northwestern. Like Fitzgerald was during his time as a two-time Bronko Nagurski Trophy and Chuck Bednarik Award winner with the Wildcats, Lowry is a lunch pail player who brings effort on every snap. He‚Äôs also a better athlete than most people realize, showing the agility to spin off blocks and make plays in the backfield (15 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks in 2013-2014). His senior year capped an excellent career, with a highlight being his school-record six tackles for loss against Nebraska. He finished as a second-team All-Big Ten honoree with 46 tackles, 13.5 for loss, and three sacks.

Keith Marshall,"It was hoped Marshall would be the next great back to play between the hedges. He was the North Carolina Gatorade Player of the Year as a high school senior, rushing for nearly 1,900 yards, and recruiters appreciated that he was the state Class AAAA 100-meter dash champion. Marshall made a great first impression, taking 117 carries as a true freshman for 759 yards and eight scores (he also had 11-91, one TD receiving). Five games into his sophomore season, however, he suffered a torn right ACL against Tennessee and missed the rest of the year (56-246, one TD rushing; 8-111, one TD receiving). He attempted to come back for 2014, but could only play three games (12-24 rushing) because his knee did not heal properly. Ironically, an injury to his teammate, Nick Chubb, made it possible for Marshall to get 68 carries (for 350 yards and three scores) in his final year with the Bulldogs. Instead of petitioning the NCAA for another year of eligibility due to two lost seasons, Marshall decided to move on and try to make his way in the NFL.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keith-marshall/32004d41-5242-9932-6591-d4257e052794

This four-year starter in the middle accumulated over 100 tackles in each season for the Owls, totaling 493 for his career. In his sophomore year, he led the nation with 8.8 solo tackles a game. And his tackles aren't just catching ball carriers after they‚Äôve gone through the hole, as he's had 40 stops behind the line of scrimmage.

K.J. Maye,"It was a childhood dream for Maye to play in the 2016 Reese's Senior Bowl, as he grew up in Mobile, playing his games at Ladd-Peebles Stadium and attending Senior Bowl practices. His inclusion in the game as a late add was not just due to Mobile being his hometown, however. Maye's athleticism was evident early in his career with the Gophers, as he started twice as a true freshman, rushing for 57 yards on 17 carries and catching 11 passes for 49 yards. His contributions did not increase in 2013 (one start; 2-19 rushing; 7-70 receiving), but coaches utilized his quickness a bit more in his junior campaign (five starts; 23-144, TD rushing; 16-298, TD receiving). That taste of production caused Maye to double his efforts last season, leading to consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors (73-773, five TD receiving; 9-46, TD rushing).

He redshirted his first year with the Gators, earning Defensive Scout Player of the Week multiple times during the season. In 2013, he made only three tackles in six games due to injury. When finally given a chance to get into the defensive line rotation as a sophomore, McCalister finished second on the team with six sacks among his nine tackles for loss (2.5 against LSU). He tied for the team lead with 6.5 sacks in 2015, even though he only played in nine games due to injury, missing the final three regular season contests with a foot injury and earning his second suspension of the year before the bowl game for violating team rules. McCalister was actually dismissed from the team at the end of the year, causing him to declare himself an early entrant for the 2016 NFL Draft.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-mccalister/32004d43-4305-7244-e653-8613ffcf07a6
Jake McGee,"McGee took advantage of the graduate transfer rule that allows athletes to finish their eligibility at another school once they have completed their bachelor's degree without sitting out a season. Although he wasn't a full-time starter at Virginia, he led the team in receiving (43-395, 2 TD) in 2013 and played well as a sophomore (28-374, five TD) after contributing on special teams (eight tackles) as a redshirt freshman. It seemed as though he was going to contribute right away for the Gators; unfortunately, he broke his left leg (fibula and tibia) in the season opener and spent the year rehabbing. As a sixth-year senior, he showed real promise as a reliable move-the-chains receiver and red zone target due to his size and athleticism (41-381, four TD), even earning second team All-SEC honors from league media.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-mcgee/32004d43-4716-9303-ca55-976d637b4bb5

He finally started all 13 games in 2015, leading the Bulldogs in receiving (58-865, four TD). He‚Äôs not putting up huge numbers like Big 12 receivers because of the Bulldogs' offense, but scouts see Mitchell's sure hands and toughness over the middle, making him a reliable No. 2 or 3 option for a pro offense.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malcolm-mitchell/32004d49-5450-2824-c23f-954590c3c61c
Chris Moore,"The Bearcats have a slew of receivers that helped the team finish sixth in the country in passing yardage in 2015, but despite the rotation, Moore has been the definition of a big-play receiver during his career at Cincinnati. Though he only had four catches as a redshirt freshman, they covered 113 yards (28.3 average) and he scored twice. Moore caught a career-high 45 passes in 2013 for 645 yards and nine scores, and then covered more yardage (673) and nearly as many touchdowns (eight) on only 30 receptions as a junior. Quarterback Gunner Kiel and Moore helped the Bearcats to that lofty ranking in 2015, with the receiver finishing second on the team with 870 yards and leading the squad with seven touchdowns on just 40 catches. His 21.8 yard per-catch average finished fourth in the FBS.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-moore/32004d4f-4f22-6734-ca64-de14861965f9
Kyle Murphy,"Murphy played like a solid right tackle prospect as a second-team All-Pac-12 pick his junior year, his first full year as a starter. In 2015, however, the brother of former Harvard and Minnesota Vikings tackle Kevin Murphy slid to left tackle and improved greatly in pass protection while maintaining his toughness in the run game. He combined with left guard Joshua Garnett as first-team All-Conference picks on the blind side of quarterback Kevin Hogan, who reaped the benefits of their play.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-murphy/32004d55-5232-1870-5fbb-531a7aaf14c4
Eric Murray,"Murray's size, durability (started 39 straight games) and physical nature should land him near the top of NFL teams' cornerback wish list. The 2014 second-team and 2015 third-team All-Big Ten selection's experience in press man coverage is extensive, and his ball skills are good enough to make plays (two interceptions, 24 pass break-ups) when given the opportunity. He stepped up his play as a senior, making more plays behind the line (four tackles for loss) and lining up ball carriers for the big hit, forcing three fumbles. He's also a special-teams stalwart who blocked two punts in 2014, which will only increase his impact as a rookie on Sundays.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-murray/32004d55-5261-5618-172a-cd1feb295e6e
Dadi Nicolas,"In a world where pass rushers are coveted more than umbrellas in New York during a rainstorm, Nicolas has the smooth acceleration off the line to make it in the NFL. The Haitian-born, 2014 second-team All-ACC pick (18.5 tackles for loss, nine sacks) is misused as a base end in the Hokies' defense, which resulted in a drop in production in 2015 (seven tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks, honorable mention honors), though he's likely to transition to linebacker at the next level for one of the many teams relying on 3-4 alignments as their base defense. Nicolas only started playing football his senior year of high school, so NFL coaches can still help him hone his skills.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dadi-nicolas/32004e49-4378-0920-33e5-b8ef5ea2f62c
Victor Ochi,"Ochi's a Long Island boy, growing up a stone's throw from JFK Airport in Valley Stream, and then moving on to Stony Brook University. Even though most college football fans haven't heard of the Stony Brook Seawolves, they should know Ochi's (o-chee) name. The New York all-state pick's college career began with a bang in his redshirt freshman season, starting five games, making 45 stops, 7.5 for loss, and one sack.  He harassed ball carriers in the backfield even more regularly as a sophomore (nine starts, 33 tackles, 10 for loss, 5.5 sacks) before starting his collection of postseason honors in 2014 by garnering first team All-Colonial Athletic Association honors (57 tackles, 16.5 TFL, 11 sacks). Ochi's ascension continued through his senior year, as he took home CAA Do-Defensive Player of the Year honors after leading the FCS with 13 sacks in the regular season (among 16.5 total tackles for loss) on a defense led the nation in fewest yards allowed.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/victor-ochi/32004f43-4829-6635-2757-5e1c4d5a90f0
D.J. Reader,"It's been a tough road for Reader since his father passed away in 2014, but if NFL scouts believe he is through that rough patch, they will have great interest in his ability to eat space in the middle of the defensive line.  Just before the 2015 season began, Reader decided to leave the team for personal reasons. He returned in October, playing nine games on the year (13 tackles, 1.5 for loss). Expectations were high for Reader coming into the season because the Tigers lost a lot of talent to the NFL, and he flashed as a top reserve as a sophomore (43 tackles, five TFL, three sacks) and junior (27 tackles, 2.5 TFL, 1.5 sacks). Even as a freshman, who was highly-rated as both an offensive line and defensive line prospect out of high school, Reader earned a lot of playing time (40 tackles).  He even played first base for the Clemson baseball in the spring of 2013, though his playing time was limited (0-for-3, three putouts in seven games).",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-j-reader/32005245-4114-8116-e0aa-521c3fdaafdb
Brandon Shell,"Yes, Brandon is the great nephew of Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Shell. But it wouldn't matter if he was instead a relative of early television-era star Art Carney ... he simply looks like an NFL tackle with a pro build and long limbs. He may be best at right tackle, a spot which he held down for three years, but he did flash athleticism to pass protect on the left side when he took over the blind side spot as a senior. Either way, if you want a strong run blocker (he will take smaller defenders 10 yards downfield once locked on) who can reach second-level defenders as well, then Shell's your man.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-shell/32005348-4528-8626-b892-24ab65d79590
Matt Skura,"A second-team USA Today All-American and consensus first-team All-ACC pick in 2015, Skura is a technically sound and athletic center with a bright NFL future. The four-year starter played some guard as a redshirt freshman, but his home is in the pivot, where his intelligence can be fully utilized. The 2014 third-team All-ACC selection's name isn't known by even more ardent college football fans, but he should be recognized nationally as one of the reasons head coach David Cutcliffe has risen the bar for the football program in Durham.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-skura/3200534b-5566-8077-6c20-88e4509c34b3
Nate Sudfeld,"Sudfeld missed about half of his junior year with an injured left (non-throwing) shoulder, but this fall he met the expectations of scouts who liked what they saw before the injury. The brother of New York Jets tight end Zach Sudfeld used his intriguing skill set (size, arm and mobility within the pocket) to pull down third-team All-Big Ten honors in 2015. Sudfield completed 60 percent of his passes for 3,573 yards and 27 scores against seven interceptions for a Hoosier squad that was not loaded with weapons. Sudfeld provides leadership and maturity, as well, and has worldly experience (served missions to Uganda before high school and for his 2015 spring break) that many others in this class do not.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-sudfeld/32005355-4419-7144-f452-fa8c30a99f40

He bounced back in his last tour of Norman, helping the Sooners compete for a national title with another first-team all-conference effort (50 tackles, 10 for loss, seven sacks). The Sports Illustrated honorable mention All-American has a strong all-around game that the NFL will appreciate.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charles-tapper/32005441-5051-7782-a78c-e916e15d53c5
Ron Thompson,"It is possible Thompson would have entered the 2016 NFL Draft even if Orange head coach Scott Shafer was kept on. Since Dino Babers was hired, Thompson decided there would be too much change involved, so he decided to move on to the next level. Former Orange defensive end Chandler Jones blazed a trail for Thompson four years ago, leaving school a year early and winding up a first-round pick. Thompson might not garner that sort of grade, but he did well enough in his final collegiate season to pique the interest of scouts. He received third-team All-ACC honors from league coaches with 35 tackles, 9.5 for loss, seven sacks, and four forced fumbles. Thompson showed promise as a pass rusher in 2013 (20 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks) and 2014, when he started all 12 games and making 32 tackles, seven for loss, and three sacks.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ron-thompson/32005448-4f68-0129-41c4-a0c48621df8e

He played in all 13 games as a redshirt freshman in 2013, getting a starting call six times (the first four, and the final two) in order to make 21 tackles, five for loss and a sack. In the Illinois high school all-state pick‚Äôs sophomore season, it looked like the consistency was coming as he started 11 times, recording 45 stops, seven for loss, and three sacks in the middle. A knee injury slowed him down during his fourth and final year on campus, limiting him to seven starts, 10 tackles, four for loss, and three sacks. Instead of returning to school to prove himself to scouts, Valentine chose to leave early for the NFL with his diploma in hand.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vincent-valentine/32005641-4c45-9261-1249-f09909997804

Brandon Williams,"Oklahoma claimed a major recruiting victory by bringing in the five-star, top-20 overall recruit out of Texas. Williams played eight games as a true freshman (219 rush yards), suffering a neck injury in the finale, from which he fully recovered. However, the Sooners' logjam at the running back position and Williams' desire to be closer to his young daughter caused him to transfer to A&M. He attempted to have the NCAA waive the transfer requirement of sitting out a season, but was denied. Williams played a part in the Aggies' offense in 2013 (44-269, one touchdown) and 2014 (379 yards, three touchdowns; 9-65 receiving) before switching to the cornerback position. He wound up starting all 13 games last fall at that position, making 37 tackles, one for loss, and seven pass breakups. The athleticism he showed on defense gave NFL scouts enough to chew on that they pushed for his inclusion in the 2016 NFL Scouting Combine.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-williams/32005749-4c00-0008-92f3-c750b3b2ae42
Bryce Williams,"Williams actually walked on for two programs in his career, first for a redshirt season at Marshall in 2011 and then in the fall of 2012 at ECU. In the past three years, he hasn't looked like a walk-on at all, earning all-conference accolades in 2013 (honorable mention), 2014 (second team) and 2015 (first team). As a fullback in the Pirates' offense as a sophomore and junior, Williams used his 6-6, 250-pound frame to its fullest in the red zone (four touchdowns), out-leaping smaller defensive backs to attack the ball in the air. As a senior, Williams has been used more regularly as an all-around receiving threat, finishing second on the team with 58 receptions for 588 yards and four scores.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-williams/32005749-4c17-0839-abff-574fdf6f43bb
Avery Young,"When Young enters the NFL, he'll find some familiar faces waiting to greet him. He is the younger brother of NFL defensive end Willie Young, and the cousin of Carolina Panthers Pro Bowl linebacker Thomas Davis. Not that he can't make his own way in the league, as the former top 10 offensive tackle national recruit earned his starting job at right tackle as a true freshman in 2012, although shoulder surgery put him on the shelf after three games, causing him to take a medical redshirt year. In 2013, Young began the season as a backup before starting the final nine games at right tackle when full healthy. Coaches moved him around quite a bit in his sophomore campaign, as he started at right guard the first four games due to injuries on the line, then moved to left guard for one game, then to right tackle for seven contests, before heading back to left guard for the Outback Bowl. In his final season on the plains, Young finished strong by starting all but one game (Jacksonville State, ankle) at right tackle.",5.8,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/avery-young/3200594f-5511-4746-faa5-7a8c392a5710
Anthony Zettel,"Most prospects don't train for the season by tackling trees, but Zettel isn't ""most prospects"" as a free spirit. He played inside and outside during a 2014 first-team All-Big Ten season in 2014 (17 tackles for loss, eight sacks, three interceptions), but wasn't able to quite create as much havoc when moved primarily inside as a senior (47 tackles, 11 for loss, four sacks, six pass breakups).

DeMarcus Ayers,"Ayers was an explosive, if undersized, running back from Texas when he arrived on the UH campus, but left after three years as one the best combination slot receiver/return specialists in the country. Getting the ball in his hands was important to Houston coaches, so he lined up as the primary kick returner as a true freshman, earning first-team All-AAC honors (37-1,021, one TD) while working his way into a starting spot the final three games of the year (11-130, one TD receiving).  Ayers continued to return kicks in his sophomore year (34-592) but also started eight games as a receiver (33-335, two TD).  With the exciting Greg Ward, Jr. operating as the team's quarterback (and leading rusher) in 2015, Ayers fed off that energy to earn first-team all-conference with 98 catches for 1,222 yards and six scores while going back to his roots as a running back at times (25-147, one TD rushing). He also moved from returning kickoffs to taking back punts, earning first team accolades there as well (28-290, one TD). In the Cougars' Peach Bowl win over Florida State, Ayers threw for a touchdown, too. That meant he had done just about everything he could as a collegiate offensive weapon, so he decided to head to the NFL instead of returning with Ward for another run in 2016.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demarcus-ayers/32004159-4526-8861-812c-31a74ed71916

He capped his time in Athens by winning a Coaches' Leadership Award as a 10-game starter (46 tackles, two for loss, sack). Bailey had also been a regular starter as a redshirt sophomore (eight starts, 34 tackles, sack) before going to a reserve role in 2014 (27 stops, half-sack).

Peyton Barber,"As a freshman, Barber was diagnosed with a learning disorder that, along with ADHD, had hampered him since middle school. Since his father had the same issue, Peyton received the support he decided both from his family and the university tutor system and did well in the classroom. He only saw the field in six games as a redshirt freshman in 2014, running the ball 10 times for 54 yards. But after a sophomore season where he chugged out 1,017 rushing yards and 13 scores (on a workhorse-like 238 carries), Barber decided to follow the path of his second cousins, Marion and Dominique Barber, to the NFL.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/peyton-barber/32004241-5207-7733-5913-58201e96ca93
Caleb Benenoch,"The son of two Nigerian ministers started his football career accidentally, and his mother thought she had signed him up for soccer when he was nine after they moved to Katy, Texas from Nigeria. Had she known how football-crazy their new home was, she probably would have known better. But it all worked out great for Benenoch, whose build is much better suited for the gridiron than the pitch. The Bruins convinced the four-star recruit to leave Texas for southern California, and rewarded him with immediate playing time. He started the last nine games of his true freshman season at right tackle, garnering second-team All-American notice and the team‚Äôs Rookie of the Year award on offense. Benenoch was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 as a sophomore, starting all 13 games at right tackle, and then proved invaluable in his versatility as a junior, starting nine times at tackle and four at guard.

Devante Bond,"It took Bond's career a while to get going, but the flashes he showed while playing in Norman gave NFL scouts something to think about. He didn't start playing football until his senior year of high school, and then went to Sierra Community College for two years where he was the conference Defensive MVP with 27 tackles for losss, 17 sacks in just 11 games. He wanted to sign with the Miami Hurricanes for the 2013 season, but he was one course short of reaching academic eligibility so he did not play at all that fall. Enrolling at OU in January, he parlayed his spring work into a strong role in 2014, starting three games a outside linebacker (29 tackles, four for loss).  His senior year didn't live up to expectations, as an ankle injury caused him to miss four games.

Brown hits both categories, as he put up great high school numbers (33-532, 12 scores in just four games as a senior, losing time to a broken collarbone) and also starred on the track as a sprinter and jumper. In fact, he ran with the United States Junior track team.  Brown started at least four games each year of his Notre Dame, improving his numbers each season.

Southwest Junior College for two seasons (first team All-Conference both years) and attended El Camino College for one year to gain academic eligibility to play at Utah. After an injury-shortened 2014 season (two interceptions in four games played), Carter was the regular starter at strong safety this fall (56 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two interceptions, three pass breakups).

Ervin's likely to play a rusher/receiver/returner role in the Dexter McCluster mold on Sundays, as he caught 73 passes for 642 yards the past two seasons in addition to his rushing work.

Travis Feeney,"Feeney made a name for himself with an outstanding senior year, as well as a memorable haircut. To pay tribute to people who he knew who passed away from breast cancer, including his aunt, Feeney had a pink-dyed awareness ribbon shape cut into his hair. It's not that he needed to do so to make himself known on campus, as he had already made an impact for the Huskies, being named the scout team Defensive MVP in 2011, honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick the following year (76 tackles, six for loss, four sacks), a nine-game starter and team Special Teams Player of the Year in 2014. His senior year was his best, however, as he replaced NFL draftee Hau'oil Kiahaha at the Buck position and earned second-team All-Pac-12 notice with 17.5 tackles for loss and eight sacks.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-feeney/32004645-4557-6222-dbb6-050052d14da8
Keyarris Garrett,"Garrett looks the part of an NFL receiver, and is the nephew of former Baylor and Atlanta Falcons receiver/return specialist David Mims (whose son, David Mims II, is a 2016 draft prospect out of Texas State and played with Garrett in high school). His career with Tulsa has had its ups and downs, starting with an injury-filled freshman campaign (six games, two catches for 10 yards), but he bounced back by earning second-team All-Conference USA in 2012 (67-845, nine TD receiving).  Unfortunately, Garrett couldn't build on that momentum, losing the 2013 campaign lost to a compound fracture in his left leg suffered in the second week of the season (7-68 receiving). His first year back from the injury was good enough to get him back on NFL scouts radars (47-698, five TD, missing two more games due to injury). He fulfilled his promise in his final year with the Golden Hurricane, leading the nation with 1,588 receiving yards and finishing in the top ten with 96 receptions while scoring eight times. Garrett garnered first-team All-Conference USA accolades for his efforts.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keyarris-garrett/32004741-5248-0903-7ae4-d3ac8440b3bb
Tom Hackett,"After an outstanding senior season, Hackett became the second punter to twice win the Ray Guy Award as the nation's top punter, joining current New England Patriots punter Ryan Allen in that feat. The Australia native finished second in the FBS with a 47.95-yard gross average in 2015, just 0.05 under the top mark. The first-team AP All-American and All-Pac-12 pick planted 28 of his 61 kicks inside the 20-yard line, and forced 21 fair catches in his final year. His junior year was equally spectacular, as he received consensus All-American status averaging 46.7 per kick, and led the nation with 36 punts inside the 20 (36) and inside the 10 (19). Hackett had been pretty good in his first year as the full-time punter as well, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors (43.4 average, 27 inside the 20, 19 fair catches).",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tom-hackett/32004841-4361-4270-32a0-4b7c8fc0ce7d
Darien Harris,"The son of a former Virginia Tech running back, Harris decided to take his talents to the other side of the ball. After two years as a special teams ace, head coach Mark D'Antonio plugged Harris in at the Star linebacker spot  in 2014 (48 tackles, 3.5 for loss, interception, two forced fumbles). Harris returned there in a third team All-Big Ten senior year (coaches, honorable mention by media), overcoming a lack of bulk with quickness and tenacious hitting. He racked up 90 tackles, nine for loss, and three pass deflections as a senior, finishing strong with 17 stops, 3.5 for loss, between the Big Ten Championship Game win over Iowa and the loss to Alabama in the Cotton Bowl.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darien-harris/32004841-5236-0107-d30b-1f60805cc0ec
Joel Heath,"Heath was seeing very little playing time with the Spartans despite a sparkling high school resume in Ohio, so it was decided he needed to move positions to have more of an impact. After playing 15 games in his first two years on the team, recording no tackles, Heath added 30 pounds to move from defensive end to defensive tackle. The growth resulted in a lean but strong interior frame which led to a starting role in 12 of 13 games played in 2014 (29 tackles, four for loss, 3.5 sacks). Heath set career highs in his second year as a starter last fall, collecting 31 stops, 5.5 for losses (including two sacks) and being named honorable mention All-Big Ten by league media.  Heath already has plans for life after football, as he's marrying his girlfriend in the spring, with star defensive end Shilique Calhoun given best man duties.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joel-heath/32004845-4172-7230-ba73-a306db253e07
Andy Janovich,"The walk-on tradition at Nebraska is strong, with many players becoming stars after failing to receive a scholarship before arriving on campus. Janovich was an All-Nebraska pick at running back and linebacker, while also winning two state wrestling titles (one at 220 pounds and one at 189 pounds). The Cornhusker staff decided to combine his experience as a ballcarrier with his love of physical play, moving him to fullback. He played in 11 games, starting two, as a true freshman (3-4 rushing, 2-13 receiving) before contributing in 13 games in 2013. Janovich battled through rehabbing a knee injury at the start of his junior season, playing in all 13 games to aid Ameer Abdullah's quest for 1,000 yards and starting the final two. He had his most prolific season as a senior, running the ball 42 times for 265 yards and three scores and catching two passes for 58 yards. Despite the drop in NFL teams looking for true fullbacks, Janovich earned an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine, possibly due to his special teams process (13 tackles in 2015).",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andy-janovich/32004a41-4e60-5717-6f99-070b55ee70e7
Quinton Jefferson,"A highly regarded high school recruit from Pennsylvania, Jefferson's career got off to a shaky start. His jaw was broken during a fight back home, putting off the beginning of his workouts with teammates. He came back, though, to play in nine games as a reserve (13 tackles) as a true freshman. Finally healthy and familiar with the defensive scheme, he started all 13 games in 2013 (45 tackles, 7.5 for loss, three sacks). Looking to build upon that performance, Jefferson started three games in 2014 (eight tackles, one for loss) but suffered a torn right ACL against West Virginia. He came back with a vengeance for his redshirt junior year, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors with 12.5 tackles for loss, 6.5 sacks, interceptions, and a blocked kick. The father of three then decided it was time to move on to the next level instead of returning to Maryland for his fifth campaign with the Terps.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quinton-jefferson/32004a45-4635-0399-dbfb-3775a6ac795c
Ted Karras,"Talk about a football family -- seven members of the Karras clan have played Big Ten football, and four of them went on to the NFL, including the late Pro Bowler Alex Karras, who is Ted's great uncle. Growing up around the game certainly aided his development as a player, but name recognition isn't why he's on this list. The 2014 and 2015 honorable mention All-Big Ten pick has been a starter for the Illini since arriving on campus, although he missed the final four games of his junior season with a torn left ACL and MCL. Karras bounced back to start all 12 games, playing quite well, as a senior.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ted-karras/32004b41-5258-2765-78d9-7663d77bb277
Nila Kasitati,"Samaje Perine set a FBS record with 427 yards rushing against Kansas in 2014, in part thanks to the blocking of Kasitati (pronounced kah-sih-TAH-tee). The big man pulled around the left side from his right guard position to cut off inside defenders, drove his man off the ball, or used his feet to seal the hole for Perine to bull through. He was just a part-time starter as a junior, though he still received honorable mention All-Big 12 notice. Kasitati was named first team all-conference in 2015 after starting all 13 games at the right guard spot. His medicals will have to check out at the combine for him to be drafted in the middle rounds, as he had surgery on a heart arrhythmia in the summer of 2012.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nila-kasitati/32004b41-5313-0394-a292-6273f466197b
Derrick Kindred,"There's toughness, and then there's Derrick Kindred.  During the 2015 Alamo Bowl press conference, he stated he broke his collarbone three days before the start of his senior season, but decided to play through the injury. It's difficult enough to play a thumper at the safety position, which Kindred is, with a mostly healthy body. But to be a first-team All-Big 12 defensive back with 87 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions and three pass breakups -- well, that‚Äôs pretty impressive.  Kindred had already secured a leadership role on the defense as a junior, receiving honorable mention All-Big 12 notice (80 tackles, 4.5 for loss, four interceptions, five pass breakups). Kindred returned two of his six interceptions for touchdowns during the 2014-2015 seasons, as well.  He had his first taste as a starter in his freshman year, starting once in 12 contests (20 tackles, two pass break-ups), and then stepped up again when needed as a sophomore, beginning three contests and playing in every game (48 stops, four for loss, two INT, five PBU).",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derrick-kindred/32004b49-4e19-2537-a82c-dc2f34fad8fc
Raphael Kirby,"The Hurricanes expected Kirby to continue his ascension to all-conference playmaker in 2015, but a right knee injury suffered against Virginia Tech ended that dream prematurely. The team captain already had 44 tackles on the year when the injury occurred, nearly matching his total from 2014, when he started every game (54 tackles, two interceptions, two pass-breakups). The former four-star prospect (18.5 sacks at Stone Mountain High in Georgia) played a limited role, mostly on special teams, in his first two years with Miami, making 26 tackles, 2.5 for loss in 20 games.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/raphael-kirby/32004b49-5209-2228-74cb-c39a3f334b37
Nick Kwiatkoski,"The heart and soul of the Mountaineers' defense (not to mention their leading tackler the past three seasons), Kwiatkoski (quit-KOW-ski) brings toughness to the field and is an explosive tackler. As a redshirt sophomore in 2013 starting at the Will spot, Kwiatkoski led the team with 86 tackles (6.5 for loss, two sacks) while also intercepting three passes. He made 11.5 tackles for loss among his 103 stops from the middle in 2014, and earned first-team All-Big 12 notice with his 86 tackles, ten for loss, three sacks, three interceptions, and seven pass breakups as a senior playing the Sam. Playing three different linebacker spots, while keeping the athleticism that he had as a high school receiver and safety, will gain looks from NFL scouts.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-kwiatkoski/32004b57-4905-9326-3c1f-c16165bd8c39
Alex Lewis,"Trying to make his own name in a new place, Lewis chose to start his college career in Boulder to play for the Buffaloes instead of following his father, Bill, to Lincoln where he was an All-American center in 1985. Alex played in 24 games, starting 15 (12 at LG, one at LT, two as blocking TE), for Colorado and then had surgery on his shoulder following the 2012 season. Lewis decided to transfer to Nebraska in the spring of 2013, redshirting that season before staking the starting left tackle spot for all 26 games in 2014 and 2015. He was named honorable mention All-Big Ten as a junior and second-team All-Conference by league coaches as a senior. Lewis now plans on following in his father‚Äôs footsteps to the NFL, where his dad played seven years for the Raiders, Cardinals, and Patriots.  Scouts will ask Lewis about his arrest for assaulting an Air Force cadet in May 2013, as he eventually received 45 days in jail and two years' probation in exchange for dropping the felony counts.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-lewis/32004c45-5703-5528-b21c-c0d6f154f3e1
Ricardo Louis,"Louis is part of Auburn football lore because of his miracle catch on a tipped pass to beat rival Georgia with less than a minute remaining in 2013. That catch helped his team get to the BCS Championship Game that season, although he contributed more than just one play during the season (seven starts, 28-325, two touchdowns; 198 rush yards). Louis started five games as a junior though his statistics didn't improve (21-261, three touchdowns; 220 yards, one rushing touchdown) because of a deep receiving corps including ""Duke"" Williams and Sammie Coates. With Williams dismissed during the 2015 season and Coates in the NFL, Louis got a chance to shine for pro scouts as a senior, making plays as the team's leading receiver (46-716, three scores; 158 yards, one rushing touchdown) despite the team's suddenly mediocre quarterback play.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ricardo-louis/32004c4f-5566-5833-3d98-5a2886c3163b

He has played corner using his tenacious man-cover skills, and was also physical enough to move to safety (58 tackles, four for loss, two sacks along with nine passes defensed in 2014). His senior year was cut short due to injury (56 tackles, three pass breakups in nine starts), but Lucas could be a nice option in the slot for teams looking to regularly bring pressure from that area. Versatility is crucial in today's NFL, and Lucas has plenty to spare.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-lucas/32004c55-4306-8819-71f2-b176439198a6

He could have applied to the NCAA for a sixth year of eligibility, as he lost the 2013 season to a knee injury suffered as a sophomore, but decided it was time to move on to the next chapter of his life. Maggitt, whose brother, Roosevelt, played defensive end at Iowa State, was looking forward to backing up a second-team All-SEC (media) junior campaign where he led the Volunteers with 11 sacks among his 15 tackles for loss.

Ryan Malleck,"Though never a No. 1 option in the Hokies' offense, especially the explosive Bucky Hodges earning touches of his own the past couple of seasons, Malleck presents enough ability to make a go at a professional career. He was a starter for the final 25 games he played, contributing as a pass receiver in both his junior (24-195, two TD) and senior (21-289, two TD) seasons. Malleck had hoped to be a largest factor in the passing game in 2013 after a redshirt sophomore year where he started seven times, catching 17 passes for 174 yards, but a torn left rotator cuff and labrum in preseason practice sidelined him for the year.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-malleck/32004d41-4c26-2135-9349-d35eb9259a63

However, he missed all but the first four games of 2015 with a leg injury, accumulating 121 yards and two touchdowns on nine catches.

Morgan did flash talent early in his career, catching 13 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns, mostly as a reserve, in 2011. Morgan redshirted the following year due to injury and managed just seven catches for 69 yards in his return in 2013.

Erickson had moved on from Tempe to Salt Lake City, as an assistant, but that didn‚Äôt dissuade Paul. In his first year with the Utes, he picked off four passes in just seven games, and his season ended prematurely due to injury (broken foot, hand).  Paul's play as a senior, however, cemented his status as an NFL prospect, earning first team All-Pac-12 honors with the second-best tackle total in the conference (109), four interceptions, three fumble recoveries (returning one for a score), and a team-leading 12.5 tackles for loss.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gionni-paul/32005041-5519-3801-4d70-544a4896bbd3

The 2011 high school All-American earned that starting role as a sophomore in 2013, making 48 tackles and breaking up seven passes.

Mountain West coaches recognized his play last fall, naming him first-team all-conference for his work at right tackle in all 14 games on SDSU's schedule.

As a sophomore, Smallwood was second on the team with 722 rushing yards and two scores on 148 carries, and contributed 31 catches for 326 yards as a receiver. He had showed promise as a true freshman, as well, (39-221 rushing; 11-132 receiving, one start in 12 games), but he nearly was untracked in the following offseason after being arrested on a warrant for a witness tampering charge. Smallwood was accused of telling someone to recant their statement accusing one of his friends in a fatal shooting case. The charges were officially dropped when his friend pleaded guilty in the murder case, allowing Smallwood to continue his football career.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/wendell-smallwood/3200534d-4175-7345-1798-ca2c5a6fb11a
Ryan Smith,"Major schools missed on this guy. The Maryland Big School All-State honorable mention pick has been a fixture in the NCCU secondary since arriving on campus, starting at least eight games each season. He tied for the FCS lead with four fumble recoveries as a freshman, while also intercepting three pases and breaking up five others. Smith had two interceptions, three pass breakups as a sophomore, recovering three more fumbles. Although he lacked a pick as a junior, he led the team with seven breakups in 2014. He starred as a senior for the Eagles, garnering second team All-MEAC honors as a cornerback (two INT, nine PBU) and returner (28.1 yards per kick return, one touchdown).   Smith also accomplished something you don‚Äôt hear very often; he set the team career record for solo tackles with 168 as a cornerback.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-smith/3200534d-4969-7570-1b00-ffa65b496420
John Theus,"The five-star recruit struggled at times early in his career for the Bulldogs, though starting at right tackle as a true freshman in the SEC is quite an accomplishment. The light bulb really seemed to go on for Theus in 2014, both in pass protection and as an effective run blocker after he moved to the left side. The Bulldog finished his career by starting every game for the second straight year and being named first-team all-conference. Theus' solid technique and underrated athleticism will make him difficult for teams to ignore early in the draft.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-theus/32005448-4569-2152-b2f3-7c772174f036
Lawrence Thomas,"Ranked in the top 30 of all recruits nationally coming out of Detroit, Thomas could have signed on with many different programs across the country.  He stayed close to home, however, signing with the Spartans. Thomas redshirted in 2011 before splitting the next season between defensive end, fullback (he caught seven passes for 78 yards), and defensive tackle. He missed the first half of the 2013 season with a back injury, managing only on the year. Thomas proved healthy the following year, starting every game (12 at nose tackle despite his tall, athletic build), making 30 tackles, 4.5 for loss. MSU coaches moved him at defensive end for most of his senior season, resulting in career highs in tackles (38), tackles for loss (five), sacks (three), and pass break-ups (six). This improvement did not escape Big Ten coaches, who voted him honorable mention all-conference.",5.6,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lawrence-thomas/32005448-4f28-7945-9b77-f11b71aa26e8
Derek Watt,"Watt isn't an athletic freak like his older brother and 2014 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, J.J. Watt, but he'll be a tough cut from an NFL roster. While not a thumping fullback/H-back, he has the athleticism to find targets and create creases for excellent backs such as 2015 first-round pick Melvin Gordon. Watt is a solid receiver (15 catches for 139 yards this season) and can contribute on special teams as well, showing off the tackling skills he possessed as a second-team USA Today All-American high school linebacker. He played the second half of the 2014 season while recovering from a broken foot in the opener, but came back to stay healthy as a senior.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derek-watt/32005741-5456-3597-eefb-60a6364b9187
Tavon Young,"Young went from high school football and track star (his 4x100-meter relay team won at the Penn Relays, set Maryland high school record) in the Washington, D.C. area to a starting corner for two games for the Owls as a true freshman, intercepting two passes. That success earned him a shared starting spot in his sophomore year (one interception, five pass break-ups). He became a playmaker as a junior, picking off opposing quarterback four times, leading the conference with 153 return yards and returning one interception for a touchdown. Young had surgery on his left knee before his senior year, but it didn't stop him from excelling in his final campaign with the Owls. His lack of statistical production kept him off all-conference teams in 2015 (41 tackles, five for loss, sack, seven pass breakups), but that was partially due to his ability to shut down opposing receivers.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tavon-young/3200544f-5529-7968-7f40-0f008a16f028
Mehdi Abdesmad,"NFL scouts weren't the only ones impressed with the play of Mehdi Abdesmad (meh-DEE ab-des-MAHD) during the 2015 season. The Canadian Football League's Scouting Bureau ranked him the fourth-best Canadian-born prospect in their list released in December 2015. Abdesmad's play as a senior was good enough to earn honorable mention All-ACC notice from league coaches (49 tackles, 15 for loss, 5.5 sacks), but it was especially impressive given his battle with injuries the previous two years. He played a total of seven games, with five starts, (21 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks) over the 2013 and 2014 seasons due to problems with his left knee. He had made a positive impression in his first two years on campus, playing in eight games (missed the final three due to injury) in 2011 and starting eight games in 2012 (25 tackles, three for loss).",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mehdi-abdesmad/32004142-4417-1953-b577-2572c35b54c1
Stephen Anderson,"Even though Anderson started his career at Cal as a walk-on, he's hoping to add himself into the list of Bears tight ends making an impact in the NFL  including former teammate Richard Rodgers, Craig Stevens, and, of course, future Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez.  Anderson redshirted in 2011 and played just four games without a catch the following year. Then he crept into the Cal offense by starting five games as a sophomore, catching 14 passes for 125 yards.  With Rodgers off to the Green Bay Packers as a third-round pick in 2014, Anderson became a reliable target for quarterback Jared Goff. His production as a junior (46-661, five TD) and senior (41-474, two TD) earned him honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors each season.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stephen-anderson/3200414e-4449-1051-5eeb-e87aeb21ea6a
V'Angelo Bentley,"If Bentley was looking for a role model growing up, it didn't take long to find one. His mother, Angela, served two tours in Afghanistan and retired from the Air Force after 25 years of service. The work ethic instilled in him showed up early in college, as he worked his way onto the field as a freshman (11 tackles, three pass breakups, blocked field goal). As a sophomore, Bentley started eight games at cornerback (22 tackles, four for loss, one interception) and led the Big Ten in punt return average with 15.8 yards per attempt. Bentley became the first player in Illinois football history to return a punt, kickoff, fumble, and interception for a touchdown after getting the first two in 2013 and the last two in 2014. He earned honorable mention accolades in 2014 (46 tackles, 3.5 TFL, one INT, 815 kick/punt return yards) and 2015 (54 tackles, three TFL, sack, 743 kick/punt return yards).",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/v-angelo-bentley/32004245-4e71-7655-4f85-c254cae6bad7
Trevone Boykin,"One of the most electric players in college football the past two seasons, Boykin was a 2014 Heisman Trophy finalist after earning consensus second-team All-American notice and Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year (3,901 passing yards, 33 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 707 rush yards, eight rush touchdowns). He again excelled as a senior, earning second-team Walter Camp All-American honors and second team All-Big 12 accolades after finishing among the nation‚Äôs leaders in several categories (3,573 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 612 rushing yards, 10 rushing scores) despite missing time with an ankle injury. Boykin was also a finalist for the Davey O'Brien (2014, 2015), Manning (2014, 2015), Unitas Golden Arm (2015), and Walter Camp Player of the Year (2014) awards during his illustrious career. Unfortunately, Boykin's career at TCU ended on a sour note, as he was arrested for punching an officer during a bar fight in San Antonio, where he was supposed to lead the team in the Alamo Bowl against Oregon. He was suspended for that game due to the incident (though the Horned Frogs came back from a 31-0 hole to win 47-41), and will have to answer to NFL teams about his lapse of judgement.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevone-boykin/3200424f-5962-0791-9930-b5279c45a779
James Burgess,"Don't let Burgess' size fool you -- he drills ball carriers into the ground. The Miami native is explosive to the play and brings bad intentions, especially when he has someone lined up in the backfield (10 tackles for loss in 2014, 9.5 in 2015). But the 2015 third-team All-ACC honoree also shows a knack for reading quarterbacks and making plays on the ball, with seven career interceptions and 13 pass breakups. Burgess also has NFL genes, with his father, James, Sr. a Miami alum and two-year player for the San Diego Chargers. His uncle, Willie Middlebrooks, was a first-round pick for the Broncos and also played in the CFL.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-burgess/32004255-5208-1920-1aa4-b20dab445b39
Joseph Cheek,"Cheek is a legacy prospect for NFL scouts, as his father Louis played four years in the NFL with four teams after being chosen in the eighth round by the Miami Dolphins. Louis also played at A&M, winning three titles in the old Southwest Conference under famed coach Jackie Sherrill.  The younger Cheek grew into a starting spot at right guard over the course of the career. He redshirted in 2011, playing in every game on field goal/special teams units, and then played a reserve role in 2013 as Johnny Manziel ran all over the SEC. Cheek finally got his chance in 2014, playing in every game and starting nine at right guard, and then followed that up with a strong year as the full-time starter at the position as a senior.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joseph-cheek/32004348-4511-7300-1839-3c8e046c0018
Fahn Cooper,"Cooper fell below the radar as a high school recruit from Illinois, so he took a scholarship at Bowling Green. He started at left tackle as a redshirt freshman, but wanted to play for a major program so he transferred to the College of DuPage to catch the eyes of recruiters, rather than sitting out a year as a transfer. Ole Miss gladly welcomed him as a starter in 2014 (11 at right tackle, two at left tackle) and he continued to excel with the Rebels as a senior, starting for the suspended Laremy Tunsil the first seven games of the year before moving back to the right side.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/fahn-cooper/3200434f-4f54-3234-a87b-bf41d732b74d
Brad Craddock,"This native Australian (the top Aussie recruit according to special teams expert Chris Sailer) won the Lou Groza Award, AP second team All-American notice, and Big Ten Kicker of the Year awards as a junior after hitting 18 of 19 field goal attempts, including a 57-yarder and a game-winner against Penn State. He also made multiple touchdown-saving tackles on kickoffs. Craddock had shown potential before that, making 21 of 25 field goal attempts in 2013 and contributing as a placekicker and kickoff specialist as a true freshman. Unfortunately, he only played nine games last fall (8-10 on field goals, 22-23 on extra points) as a dislocated bone in his right hand sidelined him for the rest of the year. Adding insult to injury, Craddock's missed tackle resulted in 98-yard touchdown for Wisconsin, who won the game by seven points.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brad-craddock/32004352-4111-8921-eed8-32eddd787659
Ken Crawley,"Since his freshman year, Crawley has used his height and long arms to distract and disrupt receivers downfield. He broke up 21 passes in his first three seasons, intercepting two others (both in 2013). Crawley continued his progress as a player during his senior year, making 46 tackles while adding another 13 pass breakups and an interception to his career totals. Crawley's lack of interceptions kept him from receiving post-season accolades, but his height and length should earn him a long look at the next level.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ken-crawley/32004352-4180-5255-6380-03d258168107
Glenn Gronkowski,"With three brothers already experiencing the NFL, it seemed logical for Glenn to head to the league a year early. Rob stars at tight end for the New England Patriots, while Chris and Dan had their time in the professional ranks as well.  (His oldest brorther, Gordie, played minor league baseball.) Glenn played a fullback role at Kansas State, participating in every game the last three seasons while getting starts in 20 of those 39 contests. His role as a fullback resulted in limited offensive production, but he found himself on an all-conference team each year. In 2013, he was an honorable mention pick (5-194, three TD receiving) by league coaches, the following year Gronkowski was a first team pick (5-99 receiving, TD; 4-6 rush) by coaches as well, and he finished off his career with a second-team all-conference effort (5-76 receiving, TD; 11-45 rush, TD).",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/glenn-gronkowski/32004752-4f13-3541-2ad9-5542f97f9d4f
De'Vante Harris,"Growing up as the son of a former NFL player (Rod Harris played four years after drafted in the fourth round by the Houston Oilers in 1989) and Aggie career record holder for kick return yards, it's no surprise that Harris attended A&M and excelled throughout his time there. The four-star recruit earned his way on the field for seven starts as a true freshman, making 30 tackles, 2.5 for loss, intercepting one pass and breaking up three others.  Harris became the full-time starter in 2013 (56 tackles, 2.5 for loss, one INT, eight PBU) but struggled through fall camp and the early part of the 2014 season with an injury (six starts in 10 games, 53 stops, one INT, five PBU). Healthy again for most of his senior campaign, Harris picked off two passes and broke up eight others, displaying enough talent to potentially follow in his father's footsteps as an NFL draftee.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/de-vante-harris/32004841-5236-3986-c910-ed44f473557d
Temarrick Hemingway,"Hemingway is not your typical tight end prospect. But his frame, fluidity and pass-receiving ability make him an intriguing threat worth developing. Hemingway earned first-team All-MEAC honors in 2015 as the Bulldogs' second-leading receiver, making 38 receptions for 418 yards and one touchdown. This was not the first year that Hemingway was a major contributor in the passing game, as he put up decent numbers as a freshman (11-164, one TD), garnered third-team All-MEAC notice as a sophomore (26-223, four TD), and first-team accolades as a junior (18-257, one TD).",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/temarrick-hemingway/32004845-4d18-9859-b65f-786360d5524b
Marcus Henry,"The 2014 and 2015 first-team All-Mountain West pick at center is not huge, overly athletic, nor physically dominating. But as far as sturdy, reliable linemen go, Henry could be seen as one of the better options in this year‚Äôs senior class. Henry also started as a sophomore at right guard, giving him some versatility that will be needed if he is to stick on an NFL roster.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-henry/32004845-4e62-5049-c0c7-2da90626a277
Quayvon Hicks,"In a time where true fullbacks are not used regularly at the college or pro level, Hicks found a good home at Georgia, where he led the way for multiple 1,000-yard rushers. He played primarily on special teams for 12 games in his true freshman season before becoming a part of the offense the following season. Hicks started six games, playing 13, and getting his hands on the ball as a runner (10-72, one TD) and receiver (5-67) as a sophomore. He again started six of 13 games played in 2014, rushing nine times for 85 yards and two scores while catching four passes for 31 yards. His production dropped as a senior (4-9 rushing; 3-34 receiving), but his contributions as a blocker were acknowledged with an invite to the NFL Scouting Combine.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quayvon-hicks/32004849-4362-3470-1263-032cbcbd13f1
Kevin Hogan,"Following Andrew Luck is not a fate I'd wish on anyone. Hogan's handled it very well, battling through inconsistency before leading the Cardinal to a Pac-12 title as a senior. He was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 Championship Game MVP in his redshirt freshman year, but failed to earn any accolades in 2013 even though his team won the Pac-12 championship. Hogan‚Äôs numbers were actually pretty good in 2014 (65.9 percent, 2,792 yards, 19 touchdowns, eight interceptions), but the team had a disappointing 8-5 season, leading some to question his ability as a leader. However, he came back strong in 2015, improving his accuracy (67.8 completion percentage) while passing for 2,867 yards and 27 touchdowns to garner second-team All-Pac-12 honors and finishing as a finalist for the Manning Award as the nation's top quarterback. Hogan certainly looks the part (6-foot-4, 218), has football genes in his family (close relatives played at Navy, Arizona, and Notre Dame), has won a lot of games (36-10 as a starter), and possesses the athleticism to be effective running the zone read (85 carries, 336 yards, six touchdowns in 2015) at that size.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-hogan/3200484f-4702-2742-4971-4e8dcf0d2a1f
Cory James,"One of the more consistent playmakers in the country over the past four years, James has flown under the radar a bit playing in Fort Collins for the Rams. He received well-deserved recognition after his senior year, as Mountain West coaches voted him second-team All-Conference as he had double-digit tackles for loss (10 of 65 tackles, with two sacks) for the third time in four seasons as a starter. James was named a Freshman All-American by the Football Writers Association of America (54 stops, 10.5 for loss, 7.5 sacks) and produced in both his sophomore (60 tackles, 12 for loss, eight sacks) and junior (51 tackles, 8.5 for loss, 6.5 sacks) seasons.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cory-james/32004a41-4d14-7142-5754-eecba4d18c4d
C.J. Johnson,"It's not often that a college team asks a three-year starter at defensive end to move to the middle linebacker spot. But Ole Miss coaches did just that in the spring of 2015, asking Johnson to return to his primary high school position as the master of the defense after owning the edge throughout his career. He started nine games inside as a senior (43 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions), missing a month to a torn left meniscus. Johnson had always been a bit light in the shorts to play defensive end, but he still came out blasting there as a true freshman in 2011 (three starts, 32 tackles, four for loss, one sack). He led the Rebels with 6.5 sacks (among 55 tackles, eight TFL) as a starter his sophomore year, and looked like he was on the way to another great year (12 tackles, four for loss in four games) until an ankle surgery put him on the shelf. Gaining a redshirt season, Johnson was named a captain for his junior year in 2014 (38 tackles, eight TFL, four sacks) for the nation's top scoring defense.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c-j-johnson/32004a4f-4813-2431-776b-de6eb8905850
Denver Kirkland,"Razorback running backs Alex Collins and Jonathan Williams received a fair amount of publicity for their efforts the past three years, but Kirkland's power up front helped lead the way for their consistent production. One of the top offensive line recruits in the country coming out of Miami, Kirkland chose the country life in Fayetteville. He was rewarded with eight games at guard and Freshman All-American honors in 2013. He started all 13 games at right guard the following year, and then moved to left tackle in 2015, starting 12 of 13 games played before deciding to leave Arkansas early to become an NFL prospect.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/denver-kirkland/32004b49-5249-7052-7ff2-4cb4ced35ad1
Daniel Lasco,"Coming off of a team MVP and honorable mention All-Pac-12 campaign in 2014 (1,115 rush yards, 12 touchdowns; 33-356 receiving), Lasco looked for a big senior year to finish off his career. Unfortunately, he couldn't stay healthy in 2015, playing in nine games due to hip and ankle injuries (three starts; 65-331 rushing, three TD; 4-24 receiving). Scouts already wondered if Lasco would stay healthy with a 6-1, 205-pound build, but he's not contact-shy.

Cre'von LeBlanc,"D'Joun Smith played on the other side of the field from LeBlanc in 2014, and was picked in the early third round by Indianapolis -- despite his talent, he was often challenged by opposing quarterbacks. Why? Because LeBlanc was just as tough to throw against. Former FAU head coach Carl Pelini said LeBlanc was recruited specifically for his versatility as a cover man/run stopper/blitzer. Given the production the FAU Defensive MVP and second team All-Conference USA corner put up despite being ""the man"" as a senior (four interceptions, seven pass break-ups), it won't be surprising if the Owls find one of their corners picked in the third round for the second straight year.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cre-von-leblanc/32004c45-4261-2957-f315-21fddc57e6d6

He again made big plays throughout his senior campaign, repeating as an honorable mention nominee even though he missed two games due to injury. Listenbee led the team with a 19.9 yards-per-catch average (30-597, five touchdowns) in 2015, which isn't surprising given his success as a sprinter; he was a four-time All-American for TCU for his work in the 100-meter dash (10.03 wind-aided best), as well as the 4x100 and 4x400 relays.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kolby-listenbee/32004c49-5358-2020-eb31-0e9ff34c5470
Tre Madden,"With an uncle (former USC/NFL corner Daylon McCutcheon) who coaches for the New York Jets, a grandfather that scouts for the Los Angeles Rams (former star running back Lawrence McCutcheon), and a father (Curtis) that played running back at Kansas State, it's easy to see how football became a big part of Madden's life.  Unfortunately, he hasn‚Äôt been able to take full advantage of his talents during his time at USC, missing the 2012 (knee) and 2014 (turf toe) seasons due to injuries and being slowed in two other seasons. He played 12 games (with one start) as a linebacker for the Trojans before coaches moved him to running back after the season. Madden tore knee ligaments during spring 2012 practices, however, postponing his debut in the backfield until 2013. He ran for 100 yards in three straight games to start that season, starting the Trojans‚Äô first six contests, but a hamstring injury caused him to take it easy over the rest of the year (he finished with 138-703, three TD rushing; 15-201, four TD receiving). It was a similar story for Madden in 2015 (85-452, five TD rushing; 17-133, one TD receiving), as he started six games to start the year, hitting the 100-yard mark twice before another knee injury limited his carries until he had surgery after the regular season.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-madden/32004d41-4419-5824-a86c-2f3a1f25b0f0

Maiava stepped in for seven starts at either guard spot as well as one as right tackle in 2013 and 2014.

The NCAA allowed waived the transfer year in his case, so he was able to play immediately for the Bearcats. He made a solid contribution to the Razorbacks in his only season there, starting 10 times and catching 21 passes for 317 yards and two scores. All McKay did in the wide-open UC offense was average over 30 yards a catch (16-485) with seven touchdowns in 2013. His junior (44-725, eight TD) and senior (27-507, two scores) seasons displayed similar big-play ability to NFL scouts despite his playing for a team that spreads the ball around to six or seven receivers every game.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mekale-mckay/32004d43-4b07-0449-2449-3c38cc78d163

He led the team with 67 catches for 957 yards and seven touchdowns in his second year as a starter in 2014, and upped his game even more last fall (78-1,105 yards, five scores) playing with freshman passer Josh Rosen. The two-time honorable mention All-Pac 12 selection by league coaches also has an entrepreneurial side, as he began Long Awaited clothing line with two friends while in high school.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-payton/32005041-5961-1897-cc49-787fbbe549ea
Alex Redmond,"Redmond's career with the Bruins started off strong, but didn't end as well as maybe he had hoped. A four-star high school recruit who also excelled as a wrestler, he forced his way onto the field as a true freshman. He started all 13 games at right guard, winning Freshman All-American, honorable mention All-Conference, and team Rookie of the Year honors. Redmond started eight games at guard in 2014, again named honorable mention All-Pac-12, but losing some playing time with a leg injury and failing to immediately regain his spot when healthy due to the play of his replacement. To finish his career with the Bruins, he played in 12 games, starting 10 inside, but missed the team's bowl game after being declared academically ineligible.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-redmond/32005245-4460-8160-bd19-8b3b0c5fa7ed
Joel Stave,"Stave was an all-state pick from the Badger State who stayed close to home and reaped the benefits, eventually becoming the winningest quarterback in Wisconsin history with a 31-10 record as a starter. He started six games as a redshirt freshman at UW, completing 58.8 percent of his passes for 1,104 yards, six touchdowns, and three interceptions. He would have started more games but a broken collarbone suffered in October cost him the rest of the regular season. Stave hit a peak to his career as a sophomore, accepting honorable mention All-Big Ten notice as a 13-game starter (61.9 percent, 2,494 yards, 22 touchdownss, 13 interceptions). His shoulder was injured in the team's Capital Bowl loss to South Carolina, however, which affected him into the next season. Eventually he regained the starting job as a junior, but couldn't connect often enough with his receivers (53.4 percent, 1,350 yards, nine touchdowns, 10 interceptions). Stave bounced back a bit as a senior, completing over 60 percent of his throws for a career-high 2,687 yards and 11 touchdowns, though that total matched the 11 interceptions he threw during the year. He gave NFL scouts something to think about with his effort in the Holiday Bowl win over USC, completing 18 of 27 passes for 217 yards and a touchdown on a big stage.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joel-stave/32005354-4181-8236-ff60-36cb9c550cac
Vi Teofilo,"Vi Teofilo (VEE TAY-oh-FEE-low) was brought from American Somoa to Arizona at the age of 12 to live with his brothers. The move paid off, as he used his size and athleticism to excel on the football field and win a state heavyweight wrestling title. He started three games as a redshirt freshman, portending his three-year reign at the right guard spot for the Sun Devils. Teofilo started 40 straight contests from 2012 to 2015 despite tearing his right ACL against Duke in the 2014 Sun Bowl. The two-time honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick played through the injury that day, and despite having surgery after the season, returned for the 2015 opener.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vi-teofilo/32005445-4f21-8145-a54f-8897056133ae
Joe Thuney,"Thuney has played everywhere on the offensive line for the Wolfpack, beginning his career as back-up center as a redshirt freshman, starting at right tackle, right guard and left tackle in 2013, lining up at left guard in 2014 before returning to the blind side tackle spot as a senior. The second-team All-ACC pick has the strong versatility and potential for growth that NFL teams covet in a mid-round selection.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-thuney/32005448-5519-8074-d99e-a02407da902b
Cole Toner,"Toner had to deal with current Indianapolis Colts defender Zack Hodges during every practice as a sophomore and junior, so most opponents on the Ivy League schedule were a piece of cake in comparison. The first-team All-Ivy League pick in both 2014 and 2015 looks like an NFL prospect, and he shows the toughness and footwork to win as a run blocker and pass protector. If the 2015 Associated Press All-American continues to fill out his frame after this season and early in his NFL career, he has a chance to contribute sooner than later.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cole-toner/3200544f-4e35-7148-9f10-4908252ecc44
Jordan Walsh,"It‚Äôs no wonder that the Hawkeyes had success on offense in 2015 with guys like Walsh up front. The three-year starter at right guard stands up his man in pass protection and anchors despite a slightish frame. He impressed league coaches enough, using his agility and explosion, to be voted first-team All-Conference this fall. Expect NFL offensive line coaches to be similarly captivated with his skill set.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-walsh/32005741-4c60-4274-fcd5-9c6f06884520
Antwaun Woods,"Googling the phrase ""low center of gravity"" should bring up a picture of Woods. It took him three years to become a full-time starter for the Trojans, redshirting in 2011 and going in and out of the lineup as a freshman (four starts, 16 tackles, 4.5 for loss, three sacks) and sophomore (six starts, 19 tackles, two for loss, one sack). Woods earned a larger role in 2014, starting 10 times and making 37 tackles and a sack, but he missed the Holiday Bowl after tearing a pectoral muscle during practice. Things finally came together for Woods in his first-team All-Conference senior season (41 stops, seven for loss, three sacks), giving scouts enough tape to see he could be the ""immovable object"" to halt the ""unstoppable forces"" known as NFL running backs.",5.5,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antwaun-woods/3200574f-4f41-2059-3719-c01a1b29ff85

Briean Boddy-Calhoun,"The Gophers lined up two of the top corners in the country the past couple of seasons with Eric Murray and Boddy-Calhoun, a junior college transfer (Coffeyville) who was tabbed for All-Big Ten accolades each of the last two seasons. In 2014, league media voted him first-team All-Conference (coaches had him on their second team) just one season after tearing his left ACL as he picked off five passes and broke up nine. Boddy-Calhoun intercepted four more passes in 2015, breaking up six others, to garner third-team All-Conference from the media (honorable mention from coaches).",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/briean-boddy-calhoun/3200424f-4232-6525-ffc0-07a70b2022e1
James Bradberry,"Bradberry signed with Arkansas State out of high school, but since the team desired him to move to safety during his redshirt year there, he decided to transfer to Samford to play outside. He's been a four-year starter for the Bulldogs, and was named second-team All-Southern Conference as a junior (two interceptions, four pass breakups) and the first team in 2015 (two interceptions, 11 breakups).

Brendel isn't as strong or athletic as some NFL teams prefer in the pivot, but others will value his other traits and willingness to get after his man in the run game enough to consider him a potential starter.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-brendel/32004252-4527-3025-f511-d9c5bdf338c5
Lamarcus Brutus,"Most Florida State defensive prospects don't fly in under the radar, but Brutus tends to be overlooked as scouts and fans marvel at the talents of All-American Jalen Ramsey. To be fair, Brutus couldn't get on the field regularly in his first three years on the team due to depth at the position. He played in six games as a redshirt freshman (no statistics) before becoming a regular on special teams (16 tackles) the following year. Brutus earned time as a safety in dime packages in 2014, recording 15 tackles and two interceptions on the year. Once he forced his way into a starting spot as a senior, Seminoles coaches didn't regret putting him in (68 tackles, team-leading three interceptions, one pass breakup).",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lamarcus-brutus/32004252-5581-9263-88f5-7facffabaa99
Taveze Calhoun,"Calhoun and Will Redmond are trying to become the second cornerback duo from MSU in the last four years to both be drafted in the top 100 selections (Darius Slay, Johnthan Banks in 2013). Calhoun came back from offseason ankle surgery to start for a third straight year as a senior. Not only did he succeed on the field (39 tackles, 6.5 for loss, two interceptions, team-best 10 pass breakups), but he was a finalist for the Campbell Trophy (academic Heisman) and was the SEC‚Äôs only National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete. In 2012, he played as a reserve and special teams ace (24 tackles, forced fumble) before getting the starting nod the following year (three interceptions, 101 return yards). Calhoun started all 13 games as a junior, accumulating 53 tackles, an interception, and nine pass breakups.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taveze-calhoun/32004341-4c42-3015-7b58-15a2b71eb899
Mike Caputo,"This Junior ROTC member garnered second-team All-American honors in 2014 from the Football Writers Association of America after leading the team with 106 tackles and coming up big in big games. He racked up 15 stops against LSU in the season opener, and he made seven stops while breaking up two passes in the team's upset win over Auburn in the Outback Bowl. Caputo's senior year wasn't quite as productive as a tackler (65 stops, one for loss) but he did intercept two passes and break up eight others. Caputo suffered a concussion against Alabama seen by the entire nation, but returned to form for the next game and didn't miss a beat, garnering second team All-Big Ten honors for the second straight season.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-caputo/32004341-5075-9395-24d6-f2ef309791a7
Lloyd Carrington,"The Dallas native followed head coach Todd Graham from Pitt to Arizona State after his freshman season, and the move has paid dividends. Carrington earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolades (58 tackles, six for loss, one interception, five pass break-ups) in just his fourth year at cornerback -- he didn't play high school football until his senior season. He repeated those honors in 2015 (53 tackles, one interception, six pass break-ups).

Trevon Coley,"Durable and productive over his four_-year span as a starter, Coley is considered to be the best defensive lineman to play at Florida Atlantic. While he's got decent play strength, solid hand usage and the desired motor, his smallish stature will be tough to overlook for teams during the draft. With that said, he's a good football player and will get his shot in a camp.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevon-coley/3200434f-4c37-8757-e081-012bcf9516bd
Cody Core,"A native of Auburn, Alabama and son of a former Troy State tight end (Thad), Core played mostly special teams, and even some defensive back, during his first two years in Oxford. But then the door opened for him as a receiver in 2014, and he took advantage (41-558, six touchdowns). Core's numbers didn't increase as a senior due to the return of Laquon Treadwell and quarterback Chad Kelly's ability to spread the ball around (37-644, four TD) but his big play ability (17.4 yards per catch in 2015) is obvious.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-core/3200434f-5225-8226-f861-d9846eff095d
Trevor Davis,"Most people spend their lives trying to get to Hawai'i at least once, but Davis decided that two years in the Rainbow State was enough, especially after head coach Norm Chow was let go. He had started 10 times in his two years with the Warriors, racking up 45 receptions for 601 yards and five touchdowns. After sitting out a redshirt season in 2013, Davis became an all-purpose threat for the Bears, making plays as a receiver (24-399, five TD) and returner (424 kickoff return yards, 70 punt return yards) as a junior. He had 40 receptions in 2014 (one of six players hitting that mark) that covered 672 yards and two scores, and had 686 kickoff return and 45 punt return yards as well.

Gerald Dixon,"If you're not familiar with the Dixon brothers, they are both sons of former NFL linebacker Gerald Dixon and were born five months apart. They both play on the defensive line for the Gamecocks, but they have different mothers. ""Junior"" is a massive nose tackle prospect who can eat blocks and shows better foot quickness than you'd expect for a two-down player.

Parker Ehinger,"Junior quarterback Gunner Kiel and his talented receivers made the headlines throughout the 2015 season, but Ehinger (pronounced EIN-ger) was a major reason for the team's success. He was a Freshman All-American in 2012, mostly starting at right tackle using his height and length. Ehinger moved to right guard for the team's bowl game that year and stayed there for two years, moving defenders in the run game and protecting the quarterback. He moved to left tackle for his senior year, using his strength and wide base effectively in pass protection ‚Äì- earning his second straight first-team All-American Athletic Conference nod.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/parker-ehinger/32004548-4942-8791-73e0-25986d60ee24
Clayton Fejedelem,"Very tough with the mindset teams are looking for from box safeties. Unfortunately, box safeties are being replaced by safeties with better cover talent and athleticism and that may be an issue for Fejedelem.

Dillon Gordon,"Gordon has been a valuable member of the LSU trenches with the size and blocking demeanor to help re-_establish the line of scrimmage. Gordon offers no value as a receiver and scouts are concerned about his willingness to stay in shape. Coming off of an Achilles injury won't help his draft cause, but his ability as a run blocker could get him into a camp.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dillon-gordon/3200474f-5211-4752-605d-89ee6f3d68a0
Aaron Green,"Green averaged 7.1 yards per rush (922 yards, nine scores on just 129 carries) as a junior, so it's not hard to see why he earned second-team All-Big 12 notice. Though he regressed to the honorable mention category in 2015, his production actually increased (1,272 yards, 11 TD). The Nebraska transfer and nephew of NFL Pro Bowl cornerback Gary Green must convince teams he‚Äôs not too much of a bounce-outside runner to be an every-down workhorse.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aaron-green/32004752-4503-4007-ec1e-d233f5cd3519

He started seven of 12 games played in his redshirt freshman season (15-150, one touchdown) and then earned 11 starts in his sophomore campaign, catching 27 passes for 358 yards while tying for the team lead with five touchdown receptions.

Darion Griswold,"Receiving statistics do not measure Griswold's potential; like many college tight ends, he is underutilized in the Red Wolves' offense. After a sophomore season where he earned second team All-Sun Belt honors with 24 catches for 312 yards and three scores, Griswold hasn‚Äôt had the opportunity to be productive in two honorable mention all-conference season (18 catches, 221 yards, four scores in 2014; just 13-187-2 in 2015).

Cayleb Jones,"As a hometown hero from Austin and the son of former Butkus Award finalist at East Carolina and star NFL linebacker Robert Jones, big things were expected from Cayleb when he arrived on the University of Texas campus. He contributed a bit as a true freshman (2-25 receiving in 11 games) before running into trouble in March 2013, being charged with felony aggravated assault after hitting and breaking the jaw of a UT tennis player. The charges were eventually reduced, but the damage was done and he decided to get a fresh start in Tucson. He redshirted the 2013 season before leading the Wildcats in receiving as a junior (73 catches, 1,019 yards, nine touchdowns) and garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors.

Robert Kugler,"It's no surprise that Kugler is the son of a coach (UTEP head coach Sean) given his athletic and academic prowess. He was rated one of the top 10 tight end recruits in the country by Scout.com, but outgrew that position during his redshirt season. The 2015 second team Co-SIDA Academic All-American joined quarterback Drew Brees and defensive end Ryan Kerrigan as Boilermakers receiving Academic All-American honors during their careers. Kugler took over as the starting center halfway through his redshirt freshman season, then started 43 consecutive games in the pivot.

He put forth an honorable mention All-Big Ten effort at safety (he started his Iowa career at cornerback), making 92 tackles, intercepting a pass and breaking up six others.

And with leaders on the offensive line Mark Glowinski and Quinton Spain leaving school, Lucas got his opportunity to step into a leadership role. Not that he hadn't contributed in previous years; Lucas was a reserve in his redshirt freshman season, started four games at guard in 2013, and then started all 13 games at right tackle as a junior.

Keith Lumpkin,"If a scout drew a picture of the prototypical NFL left tackle, it might look like a portrait of Lumpkin.

Mayes made it to Georgia for the 2013 season and stepped into a regular role (eight starts, 31 tackles, sack, two pass breakups). He was limited to a backup role as a junior, however, playing in just eight games and making seven tackles (one for loss).

Although Overton didn‚Äôt start as a sophomore, the opposition knew when he was on the field (50 tackles, 10 for loss, six sacks, two forced fumbles). He started every game his last two seasons with the Pirates, attacking the backfield and making plays in coverage as a junior (68 tackles, 11.5 for loss, four pass break-ups) and in his second team All-American Athletic Conference senior year (70 stops, team-leading 10 TFL and 7.5 sacks, seven pass breakups.)",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/montese-overton/32004f56-4548-8598-14b4-7a243ce5c34f

He missed parts of the 2011 (one catch for two yards in six games) and 2013 (3-38 in four games) seasons and all of 2014 with collarbone and shoulder injuries. Scott also faced multiple suspensions for violating team rules, missing the final three games of a strong 2012 campaign (35-512, three touchdowns in nine games) and being kept home from the Russell Athletic Bowl in 2013. Somehow, it all came  together for Scott in his fifth year, as he garnered third-team All-ACC recognition with 52 receptions for 695 yards and five scores. He must show maturity and health during the pre-draft process if teams are to use a draft pick to secure his services.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashawn-scott/32005343-4f59-4648-12cb-a6224eb60af6
DeVaunte Sigler,"Sigler's dismissal from Auburn for violating team rules after his sophomore year could have been the end of his career, especially since he didn't play at all in 2013. He worked as a brick mason that year, vowing to make things right for his young daughter. Sigler made the most of his second chance, getting his grades in order and tearing up the Ohio Valley Conference as the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2014. He also earned second-team FCS All-American honors from the Associated Press after accumulating 36 tackles, nine for loss, 3.5 sacks, an interception and two forced fumbles.  Sigler had a setback in his final year on campus, as injuries robbed him of multiple games.  Yet, he still was named second-team All-Ohio Valley Conference by making 32 tackles, 2.5 for loss, two sacks and four pass breakups in ten games.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devaunte-sigler/32005349-4733-8982-2782-b2cf712db3db
Delvon Simmons,"Simmons covered a lot of his country during the recruiting process and his collegiate career. The high school All-American from Pennsylvania signed a letter of intent with North Carolina, but received permission to leave behind Chapel Hill before he played down in order to suit up for Tommy Tuberville at Texas Tech. In Lubbock, he played 10 games as a freshman reserve (13 tackles, 1.5 for loss) and started 13 games as a sophomore (27 tackles, six for loss, two sacks). When Tuberville resigned after the 2012 season, Simmons decided it was time for a change, as well, and signed with USC. He was required to sit out in 2013 as a transfer, and then became a starter for the Trojans as a junior (44 tackles, 2.5 for loss, sack, blocked field goal). His senior year was his best, starting all 14 games and earning second team All-Pac-12 honors with 57 tackles, 10.5 for loss, four sacks, two forced fumbles and another blocked kick.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/delvon-simmons/32005349-4d16-5991-f144-0a0da491aa01
Chris Swain,"As if facing Navy's option attack led by star quarterback Keenan Reynolds wasn't enough, defenses had to deal with Swain coming downhill at them. The 2015 second team All-American Athletic Conference pick set career highs in yards (1,023) and touchdowns (10) in his senior season. Swain wasn't a one-year wonder, though, as he had over 1,100 yards and eight scores over the previous two seasons as only a part-time starter. When not running the ball, Swain shows a willingness to bang bodies and stick on a block in the hole, so NFL teams will consider bringing him into a training camp and work with him through his military commitment.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-swain/32005357-4106-7676-4480-1c3dcc0558ec
Mike Thomas,"While much of Thomas' production was churned out against middling competition, it is worth noting that he had at least one touchdown catch over his last 10 games including two touchdowns and 190 receiving yards in his bowl game against Washington. Thomas could face a struggle to get open against NFL press coverage, but his desire and competitiveness will make following his run in camp an interesting one.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-thomas/32005448-4f30-8973-820d-b24a80d48f78
DeAndre Washington,"Smart coaches take advantage of the talent that is on their roster. Former Tech quarterback Kliff Kingsbury showed his intelligence by figuring out that he needed to get the rock to his wrecking ball named DeAndre Washington, despite the team's reputation as a pass-first squad. Certainly, Washington contributed throughout his career, starting off playing in 11 games (one start) as a true freshman (77-366, three touchdowns). But that year ended with a torn ACL, so he was forced to redshirt the 2012 season. Washington got back on track as a sophomore (107-485, four touchdowns in 12 games, two starts) and became ""the man"" for Tech as a junior, garnering second-team All-Big 12 honors by covering 1,103 yards on just 188 carries (5.9 per rush) and scoring twice. Given the chance to carry the ball nearly 20 times a game as a senior, Washington proved his worth with a first-team All-Big 12 pick (233-1,492, 14 touchdowns). NFL teams won‚Äôt ignore his contributions in the passing game, either (30-328, two touchdowns in 2014; 41-385, two touchdowns in 2015).",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deandre-washington/32005741-5300-0000-c099-0198d3a23e0a
Brandon Wilds,"Wilds found himself on the field more quickly than most anticipated in his true freshman season, as multiple injuries at running back (including stud Marcus Lattimore) put him in the spotlight. He reached 100 yards in three of his five starts that year (finishing with 486 rush yards, three TD; 15-136 receiving). But Wilds' luck turned, and he was the one fighting off injuries throughout the rest of his career. A high-ankle sprain knocked him out for the entire 2012 season, while hamstring and elbow injuries limited him to seven games and two starts in 2013 (221 rush yards, three TD). He also suffered through knee and shoulder injuries as a junior but managed 570 rushing yards and four touchdowns (along with 18-143, one TD receiving). Even in his senior campaign, Wilds missed three games with bruised ribs but still led the team with 567 yards in nine starts.",5.4,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-wilds/32005749-4c04-7556-f23b-8aa233355fc0
Geronimo Allison,"Allison‚Äôs journey to Illinois was a bit circuitous. He didn‚Äôt play high school football as a sophomore or junior, so he fell a bit below the recruiting radar. Allison received plenty of major college football love after two years at Iowa Western Community College, as he helped the Reivers win a national title in 2012 and rank second in the nation in 2013 (69-872, eight touchdowns). He contributed immediately as a junior (41-598, five scores) and then earned honorable mention All-Big Ten (65-882, three touchdowns) by leading the Illini in receiving this fall. Allison is a lean strider who stretches defenses vertically and is able to high-point passes, making him a potential red zone weapon.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/geronimo-allison/3200414c-4c71-3965-6283-5b398ba32110
Alex Balducci,"Balducci's statistics as a junior didn't put him on all-conference teams; he managed just 18 tackles (three for loss) in 2014. But Balducci stood out in the national championship game against Ohio State, and he stepped up his production this fall (40 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks) and finally received the honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolade he deserves. NFL teams will see him as a late-round value, playing the role of space-eater with decent enough feet to keep gaps plugged and squeeze the pocket.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-balducci/32004241-4c24-1701-e165-11e5dfd2536e
Jimmy Bean,"It's easy to be overlooked when playing across the way from All-American defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah, but NFL scouts liked what they saw in Bean throughout the last three years. His 2013 effort (34 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks) was especially impressive coming off a redshirt season for a dislocated knee. In 2014, he again started all 13 games, racking up 42 tackles, six for loss, 3.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Bean was on the way to his best year as a senior, making 25 stops, 10.5 for loss, and 5.5 sacks in just the first eight games of 2015, but unfortunately, he missed the rest of the year with a torn ACL. Adding injury to the insult of being overlooked will probably hurt his draft status, but a patient team could find a real deal a year down the road.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jimmy-bean/32004245-4133-7135-d664-3e5102e4777d
Ryan Brown,"Brown has the long-_levered frame that is often predictive of an edge bending pass rusher, but that is not the case with his play. Brown plays entirely too upright to corner with effectiveness as a rusher and is lacking in play strength necessary to hold his ground against the run.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-brown/32004252-4f67-6527-47a9-dc0e2c51c402
Kivon Cartwright,"Cartwright missed his entire 2014 season due to injury issues, but came back and was relatively productive for Colorado State. His lack of mass and aggressiveness as a blocker are big strikes against him, while his stiffness when asked to venture outside of a straight line will limit his effectiveness getting open underneath.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kivon-cartwright/32004341-5280-6161-49d3-282d1b4eeb5f
Donavon Clark,"The Spartans had one of the best offensive lines in the country in 2015, when healthy. And when injuries took out someone up front, Clark used his toughness, stout build and length to change positions. Spartan coaches plugged him in at left tackle for four games in 2013, split his time between right tackle (five games) and right guard (eight) during his junior year, and he switched back and forth between those last two positions often during his senior year. The 2015 third-team All-Big Ten coaches' pick is best inside at the next level, and he has the attributes to provide reliable backup services, if not start.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donavon-clark/3200434c-4126-8250-a9f0-5eff31945b07
Theiren Cockran,"This tall, lean defensive end split his time between football and basketball until late in his high school career. His coach, Bobby McCray, recognized his potential since Cockran had the same build as his son, Bobby, who played defensive end at Florida and in the NFL. Since Cockran's focused primarily on football, he has been a thorn in the side of offensive lines both in high school and the Big Ten. The Gophers‚Äô reach into Florida (Miami Homestead) well worth the effort, as Cockran was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick after a senior season where he made 28 tackles, seven for loss, and three sacks. He had similar statistics as a starter in 2013 (30 tackles, 10 TFL, team-leading seven sacks)and  2014 (23 tackles, seven TFL, four sacks).",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/theiren-cockran/3200434f-4346-9423-44ca-09875519f3c3
Jared Dangerfield,"Dangerfield is proud of his football accomplishments, but even more proud of his late father, who was among the first responders at the World Trade Center on 9/11. David Dangerfield passed away from a heart attack in 2009, but would be equally proud of his son for his efforts on the gridiron. It didn't take long for the younger Dangerfield (6-3, 200) to adjust to the Hilltoppers' offense as a transfer from Fort Scott Community College; he was voted second-team All-Conference USA after grabbing 69 passes for 825 yards and 11 touchdowns. Dangerfield was a crucial part of the HIlltoppers' potent offense in 2015, as well, garnering honorable mention C-USA honors with 82 catches for 844 yards and eight scores.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jared-dangerfield/32004441-4e22-6534-6050-f68a0dd18e7b
Josh Dawson,"This high school All-American and Georgia Class AAA All-State pick only cracked the Bulldogs' starting lineup five times in his four years on campus. Dawson played in 51 games in his career, giving effort when given the opportunity to get on the field. His most productive season was 2014, when he started four games, making 17 tackles, four for losses, and a sack in addition to running a fumble back for what proved to be the game-winning touchdown against Tennessee.  The previous two years, Dawson totaled 13 tackles, 2.5 for loss in 25 games (one start). And in his final season in Athens, Dawson was again reserve, being credited with eight tackles in 13 games.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-dawson/32004441-5758-1373-ceff-7b3a230ef144
Riley Dixon,"Dixon's a tall, long-legged kicker who impresses with his ability to hang punts in the air to force fair catches: 88 of them, in fact, over the past three years. The 2015 second-team All-ACC pick (by coaches, first team by media) has the leg strength to boot the ball over 50 yards on a regular basis (50 of 215 punts from 2013-2015), as well.  He averaged over 42 yards a punt the past three seasons, finishing with a 43.7 mark as a senior. Like most college punters, Dixon will have to speed up his delivery a bit when facing NFL rushes. If he can make that adjustment, Dixon has the tools to win a job in the NFL.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/riley-dixon/32004449-5864-1722-3434-6401bfab8afa
Lachlan Edwards,"Edwards is part of the ""Australian Invasion"", the movement of many colleges to find kickers and punters from Down Under due to their experience in Aussie Rules Football. Not only did Edwards excel in that sport, but also rugby, cricket, and track and field at Ballarat University in 2012. He shared punting duties in his first year in the United States in 2013, averaging 42.3 yards on 31 punts, forcing 10 fair catches and placing 13 inside the 20 yard-line. Edwards took the starting job by the reins the following year, earning first-team All-Southland Conference honors and FCS All-American notice (44.1 average, 22 fair catches, 28 inside the 20 versus just five touchbacks). His gross average dipped in 2015 (41.5) but Edwards still received second-team All-Southland notice by placing 31-of-74 kicks inside the 20 and forcing 19 fair catches.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lachlan-edwards/32004544-5757-1443-fba6-1caa54c3ff64
DeAndre Elliott,"Elliott has gone back and forth between part-time starter and full-time starter during his time in Fort Collins, but he has consistently made plays while possessing the size/speed combination NFL scouts look for in cornerbacks. He intercepted two passes in his redshirt freshman (seven starts), junior (six), and senior (11) seasons, picking off one pass in his sophomore (10) year. Elliott returned one of his interceptions for a 76-year touchdown against Hawaii in 2012.

Taylor Fallin,"Fallin is a 23_-year-old, three-year starter who will turn 24 in November. His lack of flexibility and athleticism could limit his ability to be functional as an NFL tackle, and he might be too upright to move inside to guard and play with any leverage.

Jake Ganus,"When the University of Alabama at Birmingham decided to discontinue its football program in December of 2014 (only to reinstate it soon thereafter), Ganus and other players on the team needed to find new homes. Ganus was basically a recruit again, as many schools were interested in having him in the middle of their defense. He started 10 games as a hometown hero at UAB in 2012 (63 tackles, 3.5 for loss, three pass breakups) and led the Blazers in tackles as a sophomore (93 tackles, eight for loss). Conference USA coaches voted him second team all-conference as a junior, as he again led the team with 70 tackles, 16.5 for loss including six sacks.  Ganus picked up where he left off between the hedges, leading the team with 102 stops, five for loss, and intercepting two passes for the Bulldogs.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-ganus/32004741-4e77-9727-d60d-9b49bf2f5cfd
Johnny Holton,"The Bearcats' passing offense ranked sixth in the country in 2015, possessing enough depth at receiver that Holton only managed 17 receptions in eight games (missing time with hamstring and other injuries). But the 27.1 yards-per-catch average (461 total) and five scores caught the eye of talent evaluators. Holton has been a big-play receiver wherever he's been. First, he succeeded at the junior college level by racking up 548 yards and eight touchdowns on just 23 catches (23.8 average) for the College of Dupage (Ill.) as a sophomore and 17-289, seven TD as a freshman. Once he appeared on the UC campus, not only did he became a reliable downfield receiver (29-431, five TD in 2014), but also kick returner (45-942 in 2014-2015).",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/johnny-holton/3200484f-4c77-3557-1955-d99a202bf703
Joey Hunt,"Hunt is an underrated member of a prolific TCU offense that ranked fifth and third in the country the past two years, respectively. The Texas all-state pick on offense and defense during his high school days, Hunt was destined to be a stalwart on the offensive lines for the Horned Frogs. After a freshman season that saw him play seven games, starting once at left guard, he moved to the pivot, where he led his team for three straight seasons (save one start at right guard against Texas in 2013). Even though Hunt did not start the final three games of his senior year due to injury, Big 12 coaches named him first-team all-conference.

Branden Jackson,"Jackson absolutely looks the part of an NFL defensive end/rush linebacker, but like many Tech defenders, was underrated due to Tech's middling success and the program's reputation for offensive prowess. As a redshirt freshman, he played in all 13 games as a reserve (19 tackles, one forced fumble) and then gave a glimpse of his talent while starting every game in 2013 (44 tackles, nine for loss, four sacks). Jackson started 12 games as a junior, producing well (44 stops, 10.5 for loss, five sacks) but failing to receive All-Big 12 recognition for his efforts.

But after sitting out the 2014 season, Johnstone proved to be back at full strength in his senior campaign, starting every game and earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors.

Marshall Koehn,"Koehn (pronounced CANE) was more than a kicker playing for a four-time state champion in Solon, Iowa. He was a receiver (22-298, two TD) and defensive back (seven INT) as well as using his big leg to pound the ball through the uprights (and through the end zone on most kickoffs).  He also excelled at soccer and baseball (winning two state titles there, as well), while lettering twice in wrestling (an Iowa high school athletic staple). Koehn walked on to the Hawkeyes, and then waited for three years (redshirting 2011) to get this chance before breaking through in 2014, converting 12-of-16 field goal attempts (with a long of 52 yards) and all 38 extra point tries. Koehn improved his field goal conversion rate as a senior (16-20, 80 percent) and made 47-of-53 point-afters while making his only attempt from 50-plus yards out (57) in a second-team All-Big Ten season.

Jimmy Landes,"Long snappers are typically not two-sport athletes in college, but Landes managed the feat during his time at Baylor. An honorable mention all-state pick from Tyler, Texas, Landes walked on as a snapper on the football team for the 2011 season and got on the field much more quickly than anticipated. An injury to the starting snapper in the second game of the year put Landes on the field for 11 games as a true freshman. Although he acquitted himself well, he decided to redshirt in football for 2012 so he could focus on catching for the Bears' baseball squad. With limited success on the diamond (four starts, .048 batting average), he came back to the football team in 2013 as a back-up. The lead snapper job -- and a scholarship -- opened up before the 2014 season, and Landes excelled in the position in both his junior and senior seasons.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jimmy-landes/32004c41-4e09-7190-ef38-944ec58c956c

Once the legal troubles were behind him, and after playing the 2013 season at Jireh Prep School (35-900, 13 touchdowns), Lewis signed with Bowling Green. His impact was swift, earning first-team All-MAC honors after catching 73 passes for 1,093 and seven scores. Lewis dominated the MAC again as a sophomore, grabbing 85 balls for 1,544 yards (which ranked second in the FBS) and 16 touchdowns.

He had started all 13 games at defensive end as a sophomore, contributing 62 tackles, 10 for loss and five sacks for the Huskies, but found himself playing less in his junior campaign as a part-time starter (37 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one sack). Even Littleton's first year in Seattle was a bit inconsistent, as coaches inserted him into the starting line-up against Oregon after not playing him at all in the first four games of the year.

During those two years, he made three 57-yard field goals and a 60-yarder. Lunsford struggled a bit on kicks from 40 to 49 yards, converting only eight of 23 attempts from that distance, and he had eight kicks blocked during his career.

He struggled to get on the field in his redshirt freshman (13 tackles), sophomore, and junior seasons (two stops), even switching over to a blocking tight end spot during the 2013 season. His only start in a Seminole uniform came in a two-tight end set. Newberry served as the up-back on punt coverage teams, as well, during his career.

Marquez North,"North's talent was obvious in high school, as recruiting services ranked him among the top 10 receivers in the country and a four-star prospect. His athleticism was never in doubt, either, as he was the son of Ramando North, who played in the NFL and CFL and a member of the USA Track and Field Junior Olympic team running the 110-meter hurdles. And in his freshman season, it appeared North was destinated for SEC success. He started 11 games, catching 38 passes for 496 yards (ranking behind only Kelley Washington and Stanley Morgan in the UT books) and scoring once in a Freshman All-SEC campaign. He had a fair sophomore season (30-320, four TD), but then things started going south. He struggled with injuries at the end of the year, and tore his labrum in November. North could only manage six catches for 58 yards as a junior in 2015, starting the first four games but failing to stay on the field as injuries hampered him. Despite the maladies, North decided to declare for the 2016 draft to see if a change in scenery would allow his natural talent to shine.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marquez-north/32004e4f-5259-6863-6e75-587c5561736b
Romeo Okwara,"Even though Okwara received his degree in accountancy in December, he's still only 20 years old. The native of Nigeria started school earlier than most, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina as a 10-year-old sixth grader -- and he just kept growing, mentally and physically.  Despite turned 17 just before his freshman year, he played all 13 games as a reserve linebacker (seven tackles). Okwara started one game as a sophomore, playing in all 13 contests at linebacker and making 19 tackles, 1.5 for loss. After moving to defensive end (though he stood up at times) for the last two seasons, Romeo failed to show love to opposing quarterbacks as a 25-game starter, leading the Irish in sacks in 2014 (four, 39 tackles) and 2015 (right, 48 tackles, 12.5 for loss).",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/romeo-okwara/32004f4b-5705-9326-aeff-54de18212511

He started every game for the Wolfpack, making 51 tackles, leading the squad with 15 tackles for loss, 10.5 sacks, and forcing two fumbles for the second straight year. Rose had led the team in tackles for loss with 15 in 2014 (46 stops overall), as well, racking up five sacks in the process. As a part-time starter (four games in the middle of the year) as a sophomore, Rose had four TFLs and two sacks. He made an impact as a redshirt freshman on special teams, blocking a punt against Florida State that led to the game-winning touchdown in the team's upset win over the Seminoles.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-rose/3200524f-5327-1375-e750-32af974d5ca6

He was a top backup in 2012, playing every week and starting against Hawai'i (40 tackles, four for loss). Sarao moved from reserve to starter halfway through his sophomore year, starting in the middle for the final seven games (44 tackles, 2.5 TFL). He started all 13 games in 2014, stopping the ball 74 times and intercepting two passes.

This more than doubled his total production from his sophomore (9-123, one TD) and redshirt freshman (8-45, one TD) seasons. The 2014 second-team All-SEC pick‚Äôs production dropped off in his season year due to a team-wide lack of efficiency (26-231, one TD) and an injury causing him to miss one game.

He became such a problem for the offense while on the scout team that coaches gave him a shot to earn playing time -- and he did. League coaches recognized his play as a junior with honorable mention accolades, as he made 100 tackles, 4.5 for loss.

A.J. Stamps,"If Stamps hadn't requested to move to safety after his first year attending East Mississippi Community College, he might not have received a coveted invitation to the 2016 Scouting Combine. He played defensive back and receiver in high school, and played his first year at EMCC at receiver, catching nine passes for 73 yards. His move to safety proved a prosperous one for him and his team, as his seven tackles for loss, four interceptions, and nine pass break-ups helped EMCC win the national junior college title. The nephew of former NFL running back/returner Sylvester Stamps had little issue with the transition to SEC football in 2013, starting all 12 games and leading the Wildcats with four interceptions.

Vainuku, who had 2,202 rushing yards as a high school senior, didn't have much for offensive statistics in 2015 (two carries for four yards, one score, no receptions). In fact, he never carried the ball more than 10 times in a season for the Trojans (24 total carries for 148 yards and three TD) and only contributed as a receiver in his redshirt freshman (8-50) and sophomore (9-74, 1 TD) seasons. But he did make his presence felt on special teams each season, making 13 tackles on coverage units in 2013 and 2015, and blocking three punts as a sophomore. Vainuku was named first team All-Pac-12 on special teams and the Trojans' Special Teams Player of the Year for his 2013 efforts, and garnered second team All-Pac-12 honors as a senior for his special teams acumen.",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/soma-vainuku/32005641-4929-0361-4933-f38d1d0f803e
Halapoulivaati Vaitai,"In high school, Vaitai and his two younger brothers Will and Kevin formed the left side of his team's offensive line. Not surprisingly, Haltom, Texas' running offense was quite left-handed. Halapoulivaati was the top prospect among the three due to his size. He played five games as a back-up in his first season in Fort Worth, and then earned seven starting in year two (first five at right tackle, two at left tackle). Vaitai continued to show versatility, starting at right tackle in 2014 and left tackle in 2015.In his senior year, he garnered second team All-Big 12 honors for the second-ranked scoring offense in the country (46.5 points per game).",5.1,2016,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/halapoulivaati-vaitai/32005641-4962-6496-efba-b4cd7920840e

Fournette led the SEC in all-purpose yards as a true freshman (137.4 per game, including 1,034 rushing yards, 625 on kickoff returns). He followed that up with by nearly clearing the 2,000-yard mark (1,953) and scoring 22 rushing touchdowns in a consensus All-American sophomore campaign.

In his junior year, Barnett was a first-team All-SEC pick and first-team All-American by multiple outlets with 18 tackles for loss and 12 sacks (which ranked sixth in the FBS).",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derek-barnett/32004241-5240-5176-20ec-029ab37b9d27
Garett Bolles,"Every year there's at least one player who has overcome self-destructive behavior to take advantage of his athletic gifts. Bolles fits that bill because of his troubled teenage years. With the help of those around him, he embraced religion and hard work, enrolling at Snow College near his Utah home to turn his life around. He was a two-time all-conference pick at Snow, earning national junior college All-American honors as a sophomore. The top junior college prospect in the country chose to stay near home again to attend Utah. Bolles played well enough at left tackle to garner first-team All-Pac 12 recognition.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garett-bolles/3200424f-4c53-2335-9c0b-98c5c891813d
Caleb Brantley,"Coaches like confidence, so they won't be concerned that Brantley said before his junior season that he was ""the best defensive tackle in the country"" and that he didn't ""think it was close."" SEC coaches named him second-team All-SEC in 2016 as he tied for Gators' lead in tackles for loss (8.5, 2.5 sacks) as a 10-game starter. The former first-team All-Florida high schooler started 10 games in 2015, as well (6.5 TFL, three sacks). As a freshman, Brantley played consistently enough (12 games, 21 tackles, four for loss) to earn the start in the team's bowl game.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/caleb-brantley/32004252-4162-7462-5ad5-856829160717
Corey Davis,"The 2016 Mid-American Conference Offensive Player of the Year is the all-time leader in major college football in receiving yards (5,285). From Day 1, Davis was a great target for the Broncos despite being just a two-star recruit out of Illinois with a rough childhood and academic issues. He was the MAC Freshman of the Year in 2013 (67-941, six TDs), and then was named first-team all-conference for the first of three times in 2014 by leading the conference with 1,408 yards and 15 touchdowns (ranking third in the FBS). Davis was among the nation's leading receivers as a junior (90-1,436, 12 TDs) before garnering first-team All-American honors in 2016 by ranking in the top 10 in the three major receiving categories -- 97 catches (eighth), 1,500 yards (seventh), 19 touchdowns (tied-first).",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-davis/32004441-5624-7957-ef31-0e38b3301e4b
Charles Harris,"Harris came to the game late, not putting on a football jersey until his junior year of high school. It didn't take him long to figure it out, however. His athleticism earned him a scholarship from his in-state university, though he redshirted his first year on campus to work on his game while guys like Shane Ray, Markus Golden, and Michael Sam were chasing quarterbacks. As a reserve, Harris had four tackles for loss and two sacks, starting once while Golden was injured. His breakout season came in 2015, as he garnered second-team All-SEC honors after leading the conference with 18.5 tackles for loss (seven sacks). League coaches voted him second-team all-conference again in 2016 (12 tackles for loss, nine sacks), despite his team's poor 4-8 season.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charles-harris/32004841-5234-8374-13d2-8f7cf4bb2d8e
Marlon Humphrey,"Although his father, Bobby, was a star running back in Tuscaloosa, Marlon was not solely a legacy pickup. He was a national All-American pick out of the famed Hoover High program, as well as a state champion sprinter and hurdler. Nick Saban redshirted him in 2014 due to the team's depth in the secondary, a luxury possible for no other team in the country. Humphrey started all 15 games the following year, earning Freshman All-SEC notice (45 tackles, 3.5 for loss, three INT, eight PBU) for the national champs. He again locked down a starting spot in 2016, intercepting two passes and breaking up five others. While he didn't earn all-conference honors, his toughness in coverage throughout the season intrigued scouts.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marlon-humphrey/32004855-4d55-0259-3a83-bf518b57504a
Alvin Kamara,"One of the top high school running backs in the country as a high school senior, Kamara went to Alabama to be the next big thing. A preseason knee injury forced him to redshirt, however. He was also suspended for the Sugar Bowl and not on the sideline for the team's game against LSU for ""behavioral reasons."" Kamara left Alabama in January, but found trouble again a month later in his hometown (Norcross, GA) with a traffic arrest. He suited up for Hutchinson Community College in 2014, winning conference offensive player of the year (1,211 yards, 21 TD). Given a second chance in the SEC by Tennessee, Kamara averaged 6.5 yards per carry as a reserve in 2015 (107-698, 7 TD; 34-291, TD receiving). He was impressive again as a junior, running for 596 yards and nine scores on only 103 carries (40-392, 4 TD receiving), though he missed time with a sprained left knee (LCL, meniscus).",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alvin-kamara/32004b41-4d24-4058-5a3b-01bd39e6a25d
Forrest Lamp,"Lamp finished a brilliant career for the Hilltoppers by scoring a touchdown in the team's bowl game. It was a designed ""tackle screen"", actually, and the speed he showed with the ball in his hands was indicative of his athleticism. Lamp earned honorable-mention All-Sun Belt honors starting at guard (three games) and left tackle (nine games) as a redshirt freshman in 2013. He stayed at his left tackle home the next year, garnering honorable mention All-Conference USA notice as the team moved to that league. The past two years, Lamp was a first-team all-conference selection, starting every game on the blind side. He was a third-team Associated Press All-American as a senior.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/forrest-lamp/32004c41-4d75-2374-5b95-fb2de7d90c20
Takk McKinley,"McKinley signed with Cal coming out of high school, but failed to qualify academically. He went to Contra Costa College in 2013, winning all-league recognition with 18 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. He transferred to UCLA the following year, once his grades were settled. McKinley played in 10 games, starting one, that season (six tackles, 3.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks). He started 12 games as a junior, really beginning to show promise as a pass rusher (7.5 tackles, 4.5 sacks, four pass breakups, two forced fumbles). ""Tak"" stepped out in his senior year, receiving first-team All-Pac-12 notice with 18 tackles for loss, 10 sacks, and six pass breakups.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/takk-mckinley/32004d43-4b40-5174-ac7b-f5e10ef2c320
Jabrill Peppers,"A New Jersey kid who wanted to play for Michigan because of Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, Peppers' home life wasn't easy. His father spent most of Jabrill's childhood in jail, and his brother was shot and killed seven years ago. Football seems to be his calling, though, as he was named the 2013 USA Today High School Defensive Player of the Year while also starring on offense and in track (won 100 meters and 200 meters at state in both his junior and senior years.) Peppers' collegiate career was sidetracked due to a leg injury after three games (one start, eight tackles). He picked up the Big Ten Freshman of the Year Award and first-team all-conference in 2015 (5.5 tackles for loss, 10 pass break-ups; 72 rush yards, 2 TDs; 27.9 kick return average, 11.4 punt return average). Last fall, he was the conference Linebacker of the Year and first-team honoree (72 tackles, 16 for loss, four sacks, one INT). He did not play in the Orange Bowl, however, due to a hamstring injury that flared up in practice.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jabrill-peppers/32005045-5042-0619-4e7d-a0d4df4a4ea7
Ryan Ramczyk,"Ramczyk (pronounced RAM-check) is a rare case of a Division III student-athlete making the jump to major college football. Even though he was an all-state pick from Wisconsin, he chose to turn down offers from FBS and FCS schools (one from Wisconsin head coach Paul Chryst, who was at Pitt at the time) to attend a local technical college. After a year off, he decided to play at his hometown school, the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. Ramczyk was a two-time all-conference pick there at left tackle before deciding to transfer to play for Chryst at Wisconsin. He sat out the 2015 season as a transfer, excelling on the scout team. When the big lights came on in 2016, he starred for the Badgers, starting every game at left tackle and earning first-team All-Big Ten honors and Associated Press All-American accolades. A hip injury forced Ramczyk to have surgery after the team's bowl game.",6.7,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-ramczyk/32005241-4d04-3107-b1cd-570007956a91
Cam Robinson,"Robinson, a former top-five national recruit and high school All-American, has been the definition of a stalwart at left tackle for the Crimson Tide. The Freshman All-American and two-time first-team All-SEC pick started every game of his career on the blind side. As expected, Robinson was a consensus All-American in his junior year due to his role in Alabama's running and pass attack on their way to an undefeated season and appearance in the college football national championship game (they fell to Clemson, 35-31). Scouts will be checking into his background after he was arrested with a teammate with marijuana and a stolen handgun in their vehicle.",6.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-robinson/3200524f-4237-3063-2ed0-3f306dd57a65
John Ross,"Ross was just getting started on his way to stardom in Washington when he tore his left ACL in the spring of 2015. He had become known as a kick returner (three TDs in 2013-14) and big-play receiver in limited touches (16-208, TD in 2013; 17-371, 4 TD in 2014) before having to redshirt his third year at UW. In fact, coaches liked Ross' athleticism so much he started three games at cornerback (INT, two pass breakups) in a season he gained honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors. In his return to the field in 2016, Ross became a star, garnering second-team All-American honors and first-team All-Pac-12 accolades with 81 catches for 1,150 yards and 17 touchdowns (tied for second in the nation).",6.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-ross/3200524f-5361-6450-1052-04968bded2fc
Tre'Davious White,"Playing defensive back at LSU is typically a stepping stone to the pros, and White's talents should help continue that trend in the 2017 NFL Draft. He was a top five cornerback prospect nationally from Shreveport when entering the 2013 season, and stepped into the starting lineup in week three of his freshman year despite the available talent on the Tigers' depth chart. He finished his rookie year as a SEC All-Freshman team member, recording 55 tackles, 2.5 for loss, two interceptions and a team-high seven pass breakups. White kept that starting job with 33 tackles, three for loss, two picks, and six pass breakups in 2015. He was a first-team Walter Camp All-American and All-SEC selection last year (34 tackles, two INT, team-high 14 PBU -- ranked eighth in the FBS).",6.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-davious-white/32005748-4954-7699-8d1e-4952613e94ee
Tim Williams,"Alabama's defense could have lost several starters after their national championship title run in 2015, but Williams, Jonathan Allen, and Eddie Jackson stuck around Tuscaloosa for another go. Williams was expected to climb up draft boards with a strong senior season because of his athleticism and strength, given that he would be a full-time starter for the Tide. He didn't quite meet that expectation, though, as he started only two games in 2016. Williams was a second-team Associated Press All-American and All-SEC pick, however, as he made 31 tackles, 16 for loss, and had nine sacks on the year (no solo sacks in the season's final five games). That sack number actually decreased from the year before, as he had 10.5 as a pass-rush specialist among his 12.5 tackles for loss. In his first two years on campus, Williams was a reserve defender that played in 19 games total (three tackles, one for loss in 2013; five tackles, 1.5 sacks in 2014). The Baton Rouge native reportedly failed multiple drug tests during his time with Alabama, but was never suspended. He did, however, sit for the first half of the team's game against Kentucky in 2016 after being arrested on a misdemeanor gun charge.",6.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tim-williams/32005749-4c53-8306-a9f5-551991ebad4b
Gareon Conley,"As a redshirt freshman, Conley stepped into the starting lineup against Michigan State for an injured Eli Apple. He did not fare well against the Spartans' strong passing game that day, forcing an injured Apple back onto the field. Over the past two years, however, Conley has started every game for the Buckeyes. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2015 (two interceptions, five pass breakups) and then graduated to second-team all-conference as a junior (four INTs, eight PBU).",6.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gareon-conley/3200434f-4e24-0083-1be5-38559b415b60
Zach Cunningham,"Alabama may have overlooked Cunningham in the recruiting process due to his lean frame (he had 194 tackles, 41 for loss, 12 sacks as the state's 5A Lineman of the Year in 2012), but NFL scouts won't. He started the final five games of the year for the Commodores as a redshirt freshman (67 tackles, 6.5 TFL, 1.5), and then starting the final nine in 2015, eventually leading the team in tackles for loss (16.5) and forced fumbles (four) in a first-team All-SEC effort. Cunningham led Vandy with 125 tackles in another first-team all-conference season, with 16.5 tackles for loss.

Jarrad Davis,"The Gators collectively held their breath in October 2016, as Davis was taken off the field with a left leg injury. He attempted to play through that injury, but suffered another a couple of weeks later and had to sit out three games and most of a fourth. League coaches appreciated his leadership and production (60 tackles, six for loss, four pass breakups) enough to vote him second-team All-SEC, however. Davis built a reputation in his first three years, stepping in right away as a true freshman to play in every game (one start, 24 tackles, two for loss) and earn the team's Most Valuable Player on special teams. He was a key reserve in 2014, as well, before missing the last three games with an injury (23 tackles, one for loss.)

The nation's most prolific tight end won first-team All-SEC and All-American accolades by catching a team-high 65 balls for 926 yards and eight scores. The two-time team captain was productive throughout his career, starting with a great freshman season (21-268, three TD) in spite of missing a month of the regular season with an ankle injury. In 2014, Engram was a first-team all-conference pick after leading the nation's tight ends with a 17.4 yards per catch average (38-662, two TD).

Gerald Everett,"It's become a tradition for a former high school or college basketball player with limited football experience to become an intriguing tight end prospect. Everett played just one year of high school football while starting on the hardcourt, then went to Hutchinson Community College to hone his skills so major programs would find his talent. He showed talent in his only year at Alabama-Birmingham (17-292, 1 TD) but was forced to transfer after the school cut the program. South Alabama was glad to have him, as he earned first-team All-Sun Belt notice in 2015 (41-575, eight TD) and 2016 (49-717, four TD).",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gerald-everett/32004556-4516-6115-f11c-124334bc44da
Christian McCaffrey,"If it's possible to have a quiet 1,639 rushing yards, McCaffrey did it this season. Despite being hampered by an injury midway through the year, he still put up numbers worthy of first-team all-conference and Associated Press second-team All-American honors. McCaffrey decided not to play in his team's bowl game due to injury concerns. His sophomore season was his best, however. The son of former NFL receiver ""Easy Ed"" McCaffrey was a consensus All-American, Heisman Trophy finalist, Associated Press and Pac-12 Player of the Year in 2015. He set a NCAA record with 3,864 all-purpose yards, ranking second in the FBS with 2,019 rushing yards, along with 645 receiving and 1,070 on kickoff returns. McCaffrey was the only FBS player to lead his team in rushing and receiving yards, and won the Paul Hornung Award as the nation's most versatile player. That performance was really not a surprise given the talent he flashed in his freshman year (551 offensive yards on 59 touches) and in high school (two-time Colorado Gatorade High School Player of the Year, state records in scoring, touchdowns, all-purpose yardage).",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-mccaffrey/32004d43-4303-5988-790d-0077d6a4692b

He ran afoul of the law in July 2014, however, by punching a female student after she shoved him. Mixon was suspended for the season, and more than two years later video of the incident was released, forcing him to publically apologize. Mixon was also suspended for one game this fall for disrespecting a parking attendant after receiving a ticket. He did receive first-team All-Big 12 honors for his on-field play, rushing for 1,274 yards, averaging nearly seven yards per rush with 10 touchdowns. He also ranked in the top five nationally with 194 all-purpose yards per game (37-538, 5 TDs receiving; 494 yards, TD on kick returns).

The Washington, D.C. Mr. Football award winner in 2013 started five games the following season, garnering Freshman All-American honors (eight pass break-ups). Tabor was a first-team All-SEC pick the next season after intercepting four passes (breaking up 14 others) and scoring on two of them.

He was a second-team pick as a returner and finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as the nation's most versatile player contributing on offense (27-414, two TDs) and special teams (941 total return yards, two punt-return TDs). As a junior, Jackson won the Jim Thorpe Award and was named first-team all-conference and All-American after a strong season (five INTs, 11 PBUs.) He scored four times on returns, two on kickoffs and two on punts. In 2015 and 2016, he earned All-American honors in track.

Dorian Johnson,"Johnson was a five-star recruit as a tackle coming out of high school, but Pitt coaches convinced him that a move to guard made sense for the team -- and for his future. They were right. Since his freshman year, when he started twice at left tackle and once at right guard, Johnson has been a fixture at the left guard position. He started 39 straight games for the Panthers, winning second-team All-ACC honors as a junior as well as first-team all-conference and multiple All-American awards in 2016.",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dorian-johnson/32004a4f-4821-1755-f181-f8ed193ba078
Josh Jones,"Jones was not a household name outside of the Research Triangle during his time at North Carolina State, and was snubbed for all-conference honors by ACC coaches. League media recognized that he was an impact defender for the Wolfpack, however, giving him honorable mention notice in 2016 after he led the team with 109 tackles (four for loss) and three interceptions, also breaking up eight passes. Jones had started eight games as a true freshman, finishing second in the ACC with four interceptions (he also had seven pass break-ups for the year). In 2015, he was a solid starter but lacked many big plays (63 tackles, 2.5 for loss, one INT, two PBU).",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-jones/32004a4f-4e50-6328-8fb0-89d28754c963
DeShone Kizer,"Kizer got a chance to start at quarterback for Notre Dame as a redshirt freshman in 2015 when Malik Zaire had surgery on a broken ankle to end his season. The big-bodied, athletic passer played well given his lack of experience, completing 63 percent of his passes for 2,884 yards and 21 touchdowns. Kizer earned the starting spot coming into the 2016 season, as head coach Brian Kelly saw the young man's potential. He started the season strong (five touchdown passes against Texas in the opener) but fell into a midseason slump that saw him benched for Zaire at times. He threw for 2,925 yards and 26 touchdowns for the 4-8 Irish last year, and received sufficient positive feedback from NFL sources about his ability to leave school.",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deshone-kizer/32004b49-5a08-0286-2a4a-4466d3b555e6
Patrick Mahomes,"If you're a quarterback in Texas running the spread attack that is prevalent throughout the state, playing for Texas Tech is a natural fit. The son of the former major league pitcher of the same name has a big-league arm, and used it quite a bit in high school (4,619 yards, 50 TDs as a senior) and more than anyone else in college football the past two seasons. Mahomes began his career by starting the Red Raiders' final four games his true freshman year (1,547 yards, 16 TDs, four INTs, 56.8 completion percentage), one of those games being a 598-yard, six-touchdown effort against a top-10 team in Baylor. He earned honorable mention All-Big 12 notice for the second straight year in 2015, starting every game and leading the FBS with 393 yards of total offense per game (4,653 yards, 36 TDs, 15 INTs, 63.5 completion pct). Mahomes was a second-team all-conference pick in his final year with Tech in 2016, leading the FBS with 421 passing yards per game (5,052 total, 41 TDs, 10 INTs, 65.7 completion pct). He's also been a threat with his big-bodied frame and strong legs the past three years, scoring 22 times on the ground.",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/patrick-mahomes/32004d41-4840-1939-e4c1-bb89191b4e71
Marcus Maye,"Maye lived up to his four-star recruiting status in a spectacular junior season in 2015. He was named a first-team All-American by USA Today as a 12-game starter (82 tackles, two interceptions, six pass breakups) who ranked second in the country with five forced fumbles. Unfortunately, Maye missed the last four games of the year after breaking his arm against South Carolina. League media voted him second-team All-SEC, though, for his play in the first nine weeks (50, one INT, six PBU). Maye was a starter at safety and nickel in 2014 (62 tackles, three TFL, one INT, five PBU, two FF) and contributed regularly as a true freshman the previous year (16 tackles, one TFL, one INT).",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-maye/32004d41-5929-1409-5982-132ef981bcf8
Nathan Peterman,"A highly-recruited passer coming out of Florida, Peterman signed with Tennessee to get a chance to play SEC football. He had to feel snake-bit in Knoxville, however, since he didn't make it through his first start as a redshirt freshman or sophomore. Peterman played in four games in 2013, but broke his hand in his first start and never regained that spot (10-23, 45 yards, two INT). The next season, he was benched after two series in his only start and then was replaced by Joshua Dobbs -- who didn't let go of the reins. Peterman played in seven games that year (10-20, 49 yards). He earned his degree in only three years, however, so he transferred to Pitt to finish his career. Peterman started 11 games in 2015 (2,287 yards, 20 TD, seven INT) and held the job as a senior (2,855 yards, 27 TD, seven INT, 60.5 completion pct.)",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nathan-peterman/32005045-5407-1806-8416-0c28f3e38ba0
JuJu Smith-Schuster,"John ""JuJu"" Smith-Schuster (he officially changed his last name to honor his stepfather) took the mantle of the next great Trojan receiver immediately upon arriving on campus. A 12-game starter and second-team All-Pac-12 all-purpose selection, Smith-Schuster caught 54 passes for 724 yards and five scores, and also returned kicks for USC as a true freshman. He and quarterback Cody Kessler (2016 third-round pick of the Cleveland Browns) continued their partnership in his sophomore year, helping him attain first-team all-conference and second-team Associated Press All-American honors (89-1,454-10). Smith-Schuster has fought through injuries throughout the past few years, missing time in his senior year of high school, breaking his hand in 2015 (though he didn't miss action), and injuring his back during his junior year. That injury lowered his numbers (70-914, 10 scores), though he still received second-team all-conference recognition from league coaches.",6.3,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/juju-smith-schuster/3200534d-4982-9709-6877-2f8181b1e986
Cordrea Tankersley,"Cordrea (pronounced cohr-DRAY) got his nickname ""Tootie"" from his older brother Codarius, who repeated the word several times after seeing his young sibling for the first time. The name stuck from there, in the same manner that Tankersley sticks to receivers in coverage. He struggled to find time in the secondary in his first two seasons, primarily playing on special teams (13 tackles in 2013; 11 tackles in 2014) as the Tigers' veteran defensive backs ruled the depth chart. Once his opportunity arose, Tankersley took full advantage, garnering third-team All-ACC notice after leading Clemson with five interceptions (one returned for a score) and nine pass breakups. He was a first-team all-conference pick and third-team Associated Press All-American for his efforts in the Tigers' national championship season of 2016, intercepting four more passes and breaking up a team-high 11 throws.",6.2,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cordrea-tankersley/32005441-4e25-1970-5109-ac202ba5e091
T.J. Watt,"The third Watt brother decided it was time to join his older siblings in the NFL after an excellent junior season. Following in the footsteps of J.J. (a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year) and Derek (sixth-round pick as a fullback by San Diego) won't be easy. In fact, it wasn't easy for Watt to get on the field his first couple of seasons with the Badgers, redshirting as a tight end in 2013 and losing the following season with a right knee injury. Watt then tore up his left knee during spring practice in 2015, having surgery but returning to play as a reserve linebacker in all 13 games (eight tackles, 1.5 for loss). Finally healthy in 2016, he won a starting job and excelled, garnering second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten honors with 63 tackles, 15.5 for loss, and 11.5 sacks.",6.2,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-watt/32005741-5458-7616-6d9a-681b6f6e278d
Dede Westbrook,"Dede (pronounced DEE-dee) Westbrook originally committed to Texas State as a three-star recruit from an area of Texas northeast of Austin. But he went to Texas junior college football powerhouse Blinn Community College instead, receiving much interest from FBS schools after a junior college All-American 2014 season where he finished with 76 catches for 1,487 yards and 13 touchdowns. Westbrook chose Oklahoma as his next stop, earning the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer Year (46-743, four TD) in 2015. After three games with some success in 2016, Westbrook went on an historic stretch to complete the season, earning unanimous first-team All-American honors with 80 catches for 1,524 yards (a healthy 19.1 per) and 17 touchdowns. It was discovered that Westbrook was accused of domestic violence against the mother of his two children in 2012 and 2013, though he was never convicted in either case.

Alex Anzalone,"Anzalone (pronounced ann-zuh-LOAN-ee) came to Gainesville as a fantastic two-way high school star in Pennsylvania, but has spent almost as much time on the trainer's table than on the field during his career. He played in 10 games as a true freshman, only making two tackles as he struggled with a shoulder issue. Anzalone played in all 12 games as a reserve in 2014, making 14 stops, one for loss. He finally got his chance to start as a junior, but had to redshirt after injuring his shoulder again in the second game of the year (six tackles). The linebacker known for his long, blonde hair started the Gators' first eight contests in 2016, collecting 53 tackles (four TFL, three sacks) but again was sidelined for the end of the season with a broken left arm.",6.2,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-anzalone/3200414e-5a05-9326-7226-57708da620ee
Chidobe Awuzie,"Pro corner Nnamdi Asomugha is a family friend of Awuzie (ah-wooz-yeh), but his style of play would make you think he's a relation. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting seven games, making 59 tackles, five for loss, and breaking up four passes. Awuzie was leading the team in tackles with 64 through nine games in 2014 (along with two interceptions, eight pass breakups), but missed the end of the year with a lacerated kidney suffered in practice. Healthy again in 2015, he was a second-team All-Pac 12 pick starting mostly at the nickel spot (90 tackles, nine for loss, four sacks, two INT, 10 pass breakups).

The USA Today All-American redshirted his first season with the Trojans and then spent most of the season on the sideline after having surgery on both hips. Banner got on the field in 2014, starting every game at the right tackle. He earned first-team All-Pac-12 recognition as well as the team's Offensive Lineman of the Year Award after starting 12 games at right tackle and two at left tackle. Banner was as heavy as 385 pounds as a junior, so he lost 40 pounds and repeated the all-conference effort at right tackle in 2016.",6.2,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-banner/32004241-4e70-1016-865d-48751296db50
Dan Feeney,"In most cases, guards are not on ""draft watch"" after their junior seasons. Feeney's talent, though, made everyone in Indiana happy that he decided to return to school in 2016. The Illinois product started all 12 games for the Hoosiers at right guard as a true freshman, garnering honorable mention All-Big Ten honors. A pre-season foot injury caused him to redshirt the 2013 season, but he returned the following year with another honorable mention all-conference season. Feeney was a third-team All-American and first-team All-Big Ten pick in his third year at right guard, allowing no sacks during the seasons. Coaches asked Feeney to move to right tackle at times during his first-team All-American/Big Ten senior season due to injuries at that position.",6.2,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dan-feeney/32004645-4555-9347-23b7-c1724aa25fe0

Virginia Tech signed the Jacksonville native, and played him immediately as a freshman. Ford earned honorable mention All-ACC honors that year, leading the team in receptions (56), receiving yards (709), and receiving touchdowns (six). His sophomore year was even better, as the first-team all-conference pick set school records in each of the major categories (75-1,164, 11 scores).

D'Onta was the one exploding as a junior, however, leading the FBS with 184.4 rushing yards per game (2,028 total on 323 carries) and scoring 15 times. His six fumbles (all lost) were a bit worrisome, but they didn't prevent him from winning consensus All-American honors and the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best back.

Johnson redshirted in 2012, played in seven games as a reserve the following season (one tackle), and then had 11 tackles, 2.5 for loss, as a reserve in 2014. Given the starting role as a junior, Johnson garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors (45 tackles, 5.5 for loss, four sacks).

Graham was a two-time honorable mention Big Ten honoree with their home-state college, Illinois, and now Ethan is having his day as an All-SEC center with an NFL future. The Parade High School All-American enrolled at LSU a semester early, and it paid off when he played in six games the following fall, starting once. He got the full-time gig in 2014, lining up nine games at right guard and three more in the pivot. Pocic received second-team all-conference recognition as a junior, leading the Tigers in knockdowns with 132.5 in just 12 games.

Josh Reynolds,"Reynolds couldn't get a scholarship offer for football from a FBS school despite his manifold talents; in fact, Oregon State pulled their interest after other receivers ate up roster spots late in the process. So off to Tyler Junior College he went, receiving second-team all-conference recognition. Reynolds didn't waste any time making an impact when moving to College Station, where he was offered a partial scholarship as a hurdler coming out of high school. He led the team with 842 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns on 52 catches in 2014, the latter being a school record. Reynolds caught 51 passes for 907 yards and five scores as a junior, serving a one-game suspension for unspecified reasons.

Curtis Samuel,"This Brooklyn native is considered an H-back in the Buckeyes' offense, though that won't be his NFL position because of his size.

The first-team All-Big Ten pick rushed for 771 yards and eight touchdowns (97 carries, 8.0 yards per carry) and caught 74 passes for 865 yards and seven scores; he led the conference with 128.8 all-purpose yards a game and led Ohio State with 15 total touchdowns on the year. Samuel contributed in his first two years, as well. He played in every game of the team's national championship run in 2014 (11-95 receiving, 58-383, six TDs rushing; 12-246 kick returns). He started one game that year, and another in 2015, when he again rushed (17-132, TD), caught (22-289, two TDs) and returned (9-207) for the Buckeyes.",6.2,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/curtis-samuel/32005341-4d63-3285-ce5d-61e91947654e

He then transferred to Ashland to play football, which turned out to be the right move. Shaheen caught two passes for 85 yards as the team's No. 3 tight end in 2014. He then took over the starting job the next year, catching 70 passes (for 803 yards and 10 TDs), a Division II record for tight ends.

The Razorbacks went to the Belk Bowl this year, and as a bonus, got $450 to spend at a Belk department store the week before the game. Unfortunately, Sprinkle tried to take more than that amount from the store, and was cited with shoplifting the extra items and suspended for the game. He had played well in his senior year, however, making 33 catches for 380 yards and four scores in 11 starts for Razorbacks. In fact, Sprinkle has been a productive player ever since his freshman year (two starts, catching four passes for 68 yards).

Sutton could have left for the NFL after his junior season, where he earned All-American honors from the FWAA and Sporting News as a punt returner (25-467, two TD) and played well on defense (28 tackles, 3 TFL, one INT, six PBU). He led the Vols with 16 passes defensed as a sophomore (three INT, 13 PBU -- two vs Iowa in bowl game victory) and excelled on special teams, as well (14-158, TD on punt returns). Sutton made headlines as a freshman starter in 2013, becoming the first freshman to return an interception for a touchdown since star safety Eric Berry in 2007 when he did so against Western Kentucky early in the year.

Taywan Taylor,"Anyone unaware of Taylor's talent coming into the 2016 college football season found his skills quickly in the Hilltoppers' game against Alabama. He caught nine passes for 121 yards against the Tide's talented secondary, putting great film together for NFL scouts to review during the evaluation process. Taylor had a great senior year overall, receiving first-team All-Conference USA notice after catching 98 passes (tied for fifth in the FBS) for 1,730 yards (third) and 17 scores (tied for third). He had similar statistics in 2015, also earning a first-team all-conference nod with 86 receptions for 1,467 yards (third in FBS) and 17 touchdowns (second).

Jordan Willis,"Long-time Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder called Willis ""the epitome"" of Kansas State football. That's high praise from a Hall of Fame coach who has led the program all but three years since 1989. Willis earned that praise with his play on the field and attitude off of it. He was the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year in 2016 and also garnered third-team Associated Press All-American honors, as he made 52 tackles and led his team with 17.5 tackles for loss and topped the conference with 11.5 sacks. Big 12 coaches and media inexplicably left Willis off their all-conference teams in 2015, even though he started every game and made 15.5 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks, while forcing four fumbles (tied for ninth nationally). Willis started each game for the Wildcats as a sophomore, as well (25 stops, 6.5 for loss, four sacks).

Unfortunately, his team did lose to the Volunteers for the first time in 11 years. Nevertheless, the second-team All-SEC selection (3.5 tackles for loss, three INT, six pass break-ups) generally backed up his talk during 2016, combining with Jalen ""Teez"" Tabor to form one of the best corner duos in the country.

The reason many people were expecting great things in 2016 was because word leaked up about his excelling in 2015 preseason camp before suffering a broken leg during practice.

Dural had a breakout year as a sophomore, starting every game and leading the team in receptions (37), receiving yards (758) and receiving scores (seven). His production dipped in 2015 (28-533, three TD) partially due to a hamstring injury late in the year.

Kareem Hunt,"Hunt's 2015 season was one to forget. He was suspended the first two games for violating team rules, then struggled with hamstring and ankle injuries during the course of the year. Somehow, he still covered 973 yards and scored 12 times on 178 carries in just nine games, garnering second-team All-MAC notice. Expectations were high going into that season, however, because he led the MAC in rushing as a sophomore in 2014 (1,631) despite missing three games with an ankle injury. Hunt finished third in the nation with 163 rush yards per game and ended the year with a 271-yard, five-touchdown effort against Arkansas State in the GoDaddy.com Bowl. The first-team All-State pick from Ohio (2,685 yards, 44 TD as a senior) received a fair amount of playing time as a freshman, accumulating 866 yards and six scores. Hunt finished his Toledo career on a high note, garnering first-team All-MAC honors for the second time, rushing for 1,475 yards and ten touchdowns while also racking up 41 catches for 403 yards and a score (all receiving numbers bettered his totals in his first three seasons combined.)",6.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kareem-hunt/32004855-4e30-8934-bd0d-d8d3d09b6aac
Lorenzo Jerome,"Jerome earned enough recognition throughout his four years as a starter for the Red Flash that the Senior Bowl came calling after a senior season where he was named a first-team FCS All-American by the Associated Press. Jerome intercepted six passes in 2016, to go along with 59 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, 11 pass break-ups, and a kick return touchdown (14 returns for 405 yards). He was a first-team All-Northeast Conference selection in every season of this career, starting as a true freshman (56 tackles, six INT -- one returned for a score, 10 pass breakups). He excelled as a sophomore as a defender (79 tackles, two TFL, three INT -- one for a score, 16 PBU) and returner (14-289 kick returns, 12-136, one touchdown on punts).

Roderick Johnson,"It appears Florida State has a tight grip on the ACC's award for the top offensive lineman. First, Cam Erving won the award in 2013 and 2014 before being picked in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by Cleveland. The past two years, Johnson has received the Jacobs Blocking Trophy from league coaches because of his work at left tackle for the Seminoles.

Nazair Jones,"Jones nearly had to give up football after his junior year in high school, suffering from complex regional pain syndrome, a disease that made him unable to walk and caused him to lose 50 pounds in a month. He returned to play as a senior, but many schools backed off his recruiting trail. While redshirting in Chapel Hill in 2013, ""Naz"" added 40 pounds of weight, making him a 295-pound interior defender. Despite not starting any games in 2014, Jones led the team with 7.5 tackles for loss. Jones missed games with a leg injury and a concussion as a sophomore (40 tackles, four for loss), but was still a third-team All-ACC pick by league media. He earned that same honor in 2016, setting career highs in tackles (70) and tackles for loss (9.5) while being credited with 2.5 sacks. Jones also used his length to break up 10 passes during his career.",6.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nazair-jones/32004a4f-4e63-6681-af3f-8d816081e796
Brad Kaaya,"Even though Kaaya was an all-state quarterback out of Los Angeles (his mother, Angela, is an actress), it was a bit of a surprise when he beat out transfer Jake Heaps for the starting job as a true freshman. He went through growing pains in that 6-7 season with the 'Canes (58.5 completion pct, 3,198 yards, 26 TD, 12 INT). Kaaya improved his game in 2015, earning third-team All-ACC recognition after leading the conference with 274.5 passing yards per game (61.2 completion pct, 16 TD, five INT).

He returned to San Diego, however, to finish out his career -- and again was named the conference defender of the year and first-team all-conference pick. Kazee again tied for second in the nation with seven interceptions, breaking up eight others. His playmaking abilities started as a true freshman, when he came to SDSU after his brother, Walter, finished his time with the Aztecs as a running back. He led the Mountain West with four forced fumbles and making 41 tackles despite not starting a game.

Kevin King,"King played for former NFL linebacker Hardy Nickerson at Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, so it's not a surprise that he has the skills to play defense at the highest level. He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick at cornerback the past two seasons, using his length to make plays on the ball each season (39 tackles, three interceptions, five pass break-ups in 2015; 44 stops, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions team-high 13 PBUs in 2016). His one-handed interception in the end zone against Arizona State was one of the best plays in college football last fall. King began his career for the Huskies at safety, starting twice as a true freshman (17 tackles) and then 12 of 13 games in 2014 (65 tackles, one INT, three PBU). His senior year was the first time he did not miss games during the season, as he missed five games due to injury and one to illness during his first three years.",6.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-king/32004b49-4e56-0624-42c8-cacbf09c0609

Kpassagnon got healthy in 2015, turning in a first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association season with 9.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks.

The figure is the total of Lockwood's No. 10 jersey and Leggett's six. Lockwood passed away from brain cancer in 2011, but Leggett has stayed close with the family and wears a Livestrong bracelet every day as a reminder of his friend.

As a junior, he caught 40 passes for 525 yards and eight touchdowns. Leggett had 46 receptions for 736 yards (16.0 per) and scored seven times in Clemson's 2016 national championship season.

William Likely,"Likely considered leaving Maryland after a very successful junior season, but returned to play one more season with his teammates. He started at cornerback the first six games of the year (32 tackles, four for loss, three pass breakups), also starting at receiver in two contests (one catch for a loss of five yards, two carries for 15 yards). Unfortunately, Likely's year was cut short after he suffered a torn right ACL on a kick return against Minnesota; he finished the year with 219 yards on eight kick returns and 26 yards on eight punt returns. His return skills earned him All-American honors and the Big Ten Return Specialist of the Year award in 2015 (23-408, two TDs on punts -- 233 yards, TD vs. Richmond in the season opener; 35-789, one TD on kicks), as he ranked third in the FBS in punt return average (17.7). He was also a second-team All-Big Ten cornerback as a junior (44 tackles, four TFL, 11 pass breakups). Likely was a first-team all-conference defender in 2014, picking off six passes and scoring twice on returns (he also made 83 tackles, four TFL, and broke up nine other passes). Even as a freshman, the 2012 Palm Beach Post High School Defensive Player of the Year made an impact.

Mack led the AAC in rushing as a freshman (202-1,041, nine touchdowns) and sophomore (210-1,381, eight TDs). He finished fifth in the conference in 2016, but had only 174 carries for 1,187 yards and scored 15 times on the ground.

Raekwon McMillan,"McMillan couldn't pull off the double Butkus Award win as the best linebacker at both the high school (won in 2013) and collegiate levels (finalist in 2015), but his play during his three years in Columbus won over NFL scouts. He graduated from high school a semester early to join OSU football for spring practice, which paid off in the fall when he played in all 15 games, lining up for more snaps than the starter in nine of those contests. He won second-team All-Big Ten honors in 2015, leading the team with 119 tackles (four for loss, four pass breakups).

He repeated second-team all-conference honors in his junior season, ranking in the top 10 in rushing yards per game (138.6) and all-purpose yards (2,255) while lifting the ball 314 times and carrying the load as a receiver (37-474, four TDs).",6.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-mcnichols/32004d43-4e75-0971-c818-00cfc1798991

Wilson saw his teammate go through that process and decided that he is ready to impress evaluators with his talents. He showed them a lot in 2016, earning first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors by leading his team with five interceptions (also 54 tackles and five pass break-ups). Wilson had hoped to break out with Jackson in 2015, but he tore up his knee after an interception in the season's third game and was awarded a medical redshirt. The second-team all-state pick from Texas was a great recruiting pickup for Houston, and he showed why as a true freshman. Wilson picked off three passes and made 48 tackles that year, playing in all 13 games and starting three.",6.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/howard-wilson/32005749-4c71-4912-e8a7-3a5d4961016e
Keion Adams,"Adams is an elusive pass rusher who wins with athleticism and foot quickness, but who may lack the size and length to be considered an every-down edge player in a 3-4 front. Adams has pursuit quickness around the field and can be very disruptive when allowed to shoot gaps against the run, but he will have to prove he can set a strong edge and hold his ground at the point of attack if he wants to become anything more than a situational rusher.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keion-adams/32004144-4147-2969-d09b-361cb348f9db
Rodney Adams,"Adams' mother passed away in a car accident in November 2013, and he's dedicated his play since to her memory. He transferred from Toledo to USF after the 2013 season (2-15 in eight games), and was allowed to played right away in 2014 (three starts, 23-323, 2 TD receiving; 5-52 , TD rushing). Adams was named second-team All-American Athletic Conference in 2015 (45-822, 9 TD receiving; 10-81, TD rushing; 29.1 kick return average, TD) and 2016 (67-822, 5 TD receiving; 23-236, 5 TD rushing) due to his all-around offensive game.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rodney-adams/32004144-4155-5214-265d-3368798b4bd3
Antony Auclair,"Auclair gets check marks across the board for size, length and athleticism and it doesn't hurt that he plays with some edge as an in-line blocker. While the step up in competition will be substantial and could require an adjustment period, Auclair has all the tools to become a quality NFL backup with eventual starter traits if he reaches his potential.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antony-auclair/32004155-4338-5627-4d70-8cb9dede99db
Josh Carraway,"It was a disappointing year for the Horned Frogs, barely making a bowl game with a mediocre six wins (one over FCS for South Dakota State). Carraway, however, earned his second straight first-team All-Big 12 nod by racking up 11 tackles for loss, including a team-leading eight sacks. He had similar numbers as a junior in 2015 (11.5 TFL, nine sacks, three forced fumbles) and was a part-time starter as a sophomore (33 tackles, five for loss, two sacks) as TCU went 23-3 over those two seasons. Carraway redshirted in 2013 due to depth in the team's front seven, one year after playing in four games as a reserve.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-carraway/32004341-5244-7528-a4c7-a6ea0ac60884
Jehu Chesson,"As a junior in 2015, Chesson won Michigan's Bo Schembechler Award as the team's Most Valuable Player after making 50 catches for 764 yards and nine scores. He saved his best for the end of the season with big games against Indiana (207 yards, four TDs), Ohio State (8-111, TD) and an MVP performance in the Citrus Bowl win over Florida (5-118, TD). Chesson suffered a knee injury in the bowl game, which slowed him coming into 2016. He didn't connect with Michigan's new quarterback, Wilton Speight, this fall as much as he did with Jake Rudock the previous year (35-500, 2 TDs). Chesson's jump in 2015 followed a redshirt year and two seasons as a reserve (15-221, TD in 2013; 14-154 in 2014).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jehu-chesson/32004348-4558-2035-37ba-7b9e42d39237
Tarik Cohen,"While only a bit over 5-foot-6 and 175 pounds, Cohen was one of the most productive running backs at the FCS level the past four seasons. The MEAC's all-time leading rusher (5,619 yards) and first three-time conference Offensive Player of the Year was an All-American in 2016, setting a school record with 1,588 yards and 19 touchdowns on 212 carries (37-339, one TD receiving). Cohen was a third-team All-American as a junior (264-1,543, 15 TD rushing; 25-217 receiving) and led the MEAC in scoring as well as rushing in 2014 (197-1,340, 15 TD rushing; 25-237, one TD receiving). Though he started only six games as a freshman, Cohen managed to run for 1,148 yards and eight scores on 195 attempts (11-152, one TD receiving).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tarik-cohen/3200434f-4842-7642-223a-04d61d35fb5c
Stacy Coley,"There was fear that Coley would be caught up in a NCAA investigation into improper car rental benefits before the 2016 season, but the star receiver was cleared to work with quarterback Brad Kaaya this fall. In fact, Coley caught the pass that made Kaaya the school's all-time leader in passing yardage. The past two seasons, Coley was named third-team All-ACC because of his playmaking abilities. He led the Canes in receptions with 63 this year, covering 754 yards and scoring nine times. Coley was a part-time starter in each of his first three seasons as well (33-591, 7 TD in 2013; 23-184 in 2014; 47-689, 4 TD while fighting a hamstring injury in 2015).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stacy-coley/3200434f-4c37-7475-3f2e-c5d38db2bad5
Aviante Collins,"Collins' father, Bill, and brother, Lavon, have made their name as sprinters for TCU track and field. Aviante's (AH-vee-on) large frame, however, made him a better fit on the offensive line for the Horned Frogs. He became a starter immediately, playing in every game at right tackle (10 starts) and left tackle (three starts). His versatility showed again in 2013, as he played in 12 games, starting the first three games at left tackle and the final six on the right side. Collins' career took a dip, however, as he only suited up eight times as a junior (one start at left tackle), and then played in the first three games of the 2015 season before redshirting due to injury. He bounced back in his final year in Fort Worth, however, starting every game at right tackle.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aviante-collins/3200434f-4c51-3500-47e4-1a8e6f8e328a
James Conner,"Conner has become one of the best stories coming out of college football the past couple of seasons, overcoming a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma to return to the field. He won the Disney Spirit Award and the ACC Brian Piccolo Award as rewards for beating cancer, but his best accomplishment was earning first-team all-conference recognition by carrying the ball 216 times for 1,092 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. Doctors found the issue while Conner was trying to rehabilitate a torn right MCL that forced him to miss all but the opener of the 2015 season. Conner made a name for himself by racking up 1,765 yards and 26 scores as a sophomore, garnering second-team AP All-American and ACC Player of the Year honors. He ranked third in the FBS in rushing yards despite being hindered by a hip injury the final two regular season games. In his true freshman season, Conner came on late, setting a school bowl record with 229 yards against Bowling Green as the Little Caesar's Bowl MVP (he had 799 yards, eight TDs total on the year.)",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-conner/3200434f-4e46-1999-59e9-253cedeec3a5
Bryan Cox,"The son of three-time Pro Bowl linebacker Bryan Cox had an up-and-down career with the Gators. After playing a reserve role as a freshman (eight games, five tackles, two sacks), he won a starting job in 2014 (29 tackles, six for loss, four sacks). Despite having hip surgery after the regular season that year, Cox came back to start 12 games as a junior, setting career highs in tackles (45), tackles for loss (10.5), sacks (3.5) and forced fumbles (two). Injuries limited his effectiveness in 2016, allowing him to only make 19 tackles (2.5 for loss, 0.5 sack) in 11 games. His favorite team to play against was Tennessee, as he had five tackles for loss and three sacks against the Volunteers in 2014, and a career-high nine tackles this fall.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryan-cox/3200434f-5815-1958-ea69-fdd535caeed5
Matt Dayes,"Dayes did not get the headlines like other ACC backs like Dalvin Cook and James Conner, but he's been a valued all-around offensive threat for the Wolfpack throughout his career. Going from Fort Lauderdale to Raleigh, Dayes earned carries (63 for 252 yards, four TD) and was used as a receiver (10-173, TD) as a true freshman. In 2014, he was one of just three players in the FBS with at least 300 yards rushing (573), receiving (32-321, 5 TD) and on kick returns (384) despite starting just two games. Dayes was breaking out on the national scene in 2015, and was leading the FBS with 12 rushing touchdowns through nine games, but suffered a season-ending turf toe injury (finished with 865 rushing yards, 24-172 receiving). His 2016 season was his best, as he covered 1,166 yards on the ground with 10 scores, while also catching 32 passes for 267 yards on his way to second-team All-ACC honors.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-dayes/32004441-5950-6590-6ff5-89131825b5f2
Dylan Donahue,"Dylan is the son of Mitch Donahue, who was the WAC Defensive Player of the Year in 1989 and 1990 for Wyoming and went on to play four years in the NFL. Donahue wears the same number 49 jersey as his dad. He ended up going the junior college route coming out of high school in Billings, Montana (where his dad owns a roofing company). He racked up 19 sacks in two years at Palomar College before heading to UWG for the 2015 season. Donahue impressed Wolves coaches enough to get on the field right away, and he received second-team Associated Press Little All-American team honors that season (52 tackles, 17.5 for loss, 12 sacks). He was the Gulf South Defensive Player of the Year in 2016, along with multiple All-American honors, after setting the conference record with 13.5 sacks (67 tackles, 20 for loss).

Malachi Dupre,"Malachi Dupre (Mal-uh-kye Doo-pree) was not voted first or second-team all-conference during his career, and has not ranked among the more prolific receivers in the country due to the Tigers' inconsistent quarterback play. Dupre actually led LSU in receptions and receiving yards each of the past two seasons, even though his statistics aren't extraordinary (43-698, six TDs in 2015; 41-593, three TDs in 2016). The former five-star prospect and high school state champion triple, long, and high-jumper from New Orleans was voted to the SEC's All-Freshman team in 2014, however, by averaging 22.7 yards per reception (14-318, five TDs).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malachi-dupre/32004455-5042-6913-b1a7-e0c89cead666
Corn Elder,"Elder is one of many players that changed positions when they entered college -- and the move has paid off. He was a top 30 running back prospect nationally, however, coming out of Nashville as he was named Mr. Football Running Back of the Year for Tennessee as a junior and senior (2,618 rush yards, 39 TD). Given his size (5-foot-10, 180) and tenacious attitude, Miami coaches moved Elder to cornerback for his true freshman season in 2013 (seven tackles, missed two games with injury). He played often as a reserve, plus one start, in 2014 (34 tackles, three for loss, four breakups) before becoming a key member of the secondary as a junior (seven starts, 41 tackles, four for loss, two sacks, two INT, 11 pass breakups). Elder also returned both a kickoff and punt return in 2015. ACC coaches named him first-team all-conference for his play as a senior, as he made 76 tackles, 4.5 for loss, intercepting one pass and breaking up 12 others.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corn-elder/3200454c-4440-3291-ab59-2b5da5316c8c

He went to Lackawanna College in 2012 and 2013, earning second-team all-conference honors in his second season. Eluemunor redshirted in 2014 and was a back-up at right guard and he continued to learn the game in 2015.

Wayne Gallman,"Playing on the same team as perennial Heisman contender Deshaun Watson and star receiver Mike Williams has put Gallman a bit in the shadows nationally. The son of a Marine (Wayne, Sr.) has been an all-conference pick the past two years, however. As a redshirt freshman, he took over the starting job nine times, running for a team-high 769 yards and four scores. Things got real in 2015, as Gallman actually shared the team's Offensive MVP Award with Watson and was named first-team All-ACC after setting a school record with 1,527 rushing yards. Although he received considerably fewer carries as a junior (196 versus 283 in 2015), he still earned second-team All-ACC accolades with 1,002 yards and scored a career-high 15 times on the ground.

Avery Gennesy,"A&M has become a place that scouts look for offensive linemen, as the Aggies have produced first-round picks on the line in the past four drafts. Whether or not Gennesy is selected that high, league coaches believed he played well enough at the left tackle spot in 2016 to earn first-team All-SEC honors. He originally planned to go to Arkansas State out of high school, but failed to qualify academically. After two years at East Mississippi Community College (where he won a national title), Gennesy spent a redshirt year in College Station.

Ryan Glasgow,"Ryan hopes to follow in the footsteps of his brother, Graham, who is a starting guard for the Detroit Lions as a rookie. He took a step in that direction by garnering second-team All-Big Ten notice and the team's Defensive Lineman of the Year in his final season (39 tackles, 9.5 for loss, four sacks). Glasgow was just happy to return to the field after missing the end of his junior year with a torn pectoral muscle (nine starts, 25 tackles, five for loss). He was a starter in 2014, as well (22 tackles, four for loss) following two years without much playing time (redshirted in 2012, two tackles in 11 games in 2013).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-glasgow/3200474c-4138-8030-2779-0b2c492b7522
Davon Godchaux,"Godchaux had a rough life growing up in Louisiana, even having his home riddled by bullets in a drive-by meant for one of his brothers. Despite missing all but the opener of his senior year in high school, LSU stuck by him -- and it's paid off. He started 10 times as a true freshman (including the final nine) on a line full of NFL talent, making 42 stops. The next year, Godchaux started every game, making nine plays behind the line including six sacks (two against Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl). SEC coaches left him off their all-conference teams in 2016, but the junior tackle played very well (7.5 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks). The lack of accolades had more to do with the number of sack artists in the conference, rather than a tale of his talent.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davon-godchaux/3200474f-4409-3943-f3b0-e1ac6f3b3b13
Kenny Golladay,"One of the better players coming out of the Chicago area in 2011, Golladay ended up at North Dakota to start his college career.

The head coach was fired after that season, however, so Golladay moved back home to play for Northern Illinois. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer redshirt, then stepped into the line-up without any fears of moving up a level of football. He was a second-team All-MAC pick with 73 catches for 1,129 yards and 10 touchdowns.

Griffin played as a reserve in 2014, as well (17 tackles, one interception). He earned a starting role in his junior year, playing nine games at cornerback and two at safety (50 tackles, two interceptions -- one for TD, 13 PBU).

His production was only slightly better in 2014 (13-88 in seven games) before the team switched him to defense.

He capped his career by setting the tackles record and winning numerous All-American honors (138 stops, 8.5 TFL, two INT -- one for a score).

He played in 10 games as a reserve in his first year in Fayetteville (3-21, TD), and then earned a part-time starting job in 2013 (27-346, two TD). Hatcher stepped up as a go-to guy in 12 starts as a junior, leading the team in receiving yards (43-558, six TD), which led to the high expectations going into his first senior year.

The signing paid off in 2015, with Kelly earning second-team All-SEC nod (4,042 yards, 31 TD, 13 INT passing; 500 yards, 10 TD rushing)and the Sugar Bowl MVP while leading Ole Miss to wins over Alabama, Auburn and LSU in the same year for the first time in school history. Kelly was named second-team All-SEC as a senior, as well, even though his career ended early due to a torn right ACL and lateral meniscus in November 2016 (306.4 passing yards/game, 19 TD, eight INT). He didn't stay out of the headlines in 2016, either, as he ran onto the field of a high school game in which his brother was playing because the young quarterback took a late hit out of bounds. Reports were that Kelly did not actually engage anyone in the melee but apologized for leaving the stands.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chad-kelly/32004b45-4c51-6446-3e7e-af1a2c479726
George Kittle,"Kittle's Hawkeyes ties are strong, as his father, Bruce, was a co-captain on Iowa's 1982 Rose Bowl team. One cousin, Jess Settles, was an excellent basketball player for Iowa in the mid-nineties and another is former Iowa and current Denver Broncos tight end Henry Kreiger-Coble. Kittle redshirted in 2012, played in a reserve role in 2013 (5-108 receiving) and 2014 (1-25 receiving). He shared playing time in 2015, starting six of 14 games, catching 20 passes for 290 yards and a team-high six receiving touchdowns. Kittle was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick last season (11 starts, 22-314, four TD), even though he was limited by a foot injury the second half of the year.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/george-kittle/32004b49-5438-8290-eeed-c9c9cca62ec1
Brendan Langley,"A Marietta, Georgia native, Langley signed on with the home-state Bulldogs as a top 25 cornerback recruit nationally. However, the team asked him to move to receiver at the start of his freshman season. Eventually Langley moved back to the cornerback spot later that year, even starting four games in nine appearances (12 tackles, two PBU). He played just five games, starting once, at Georgia in 2014 (four tackles, one TFL, one PBU). Looking for more playing time, he transferred to Lamar for his junior year (11 games, three starts, 21 tackles, one interception for 86-yard TD, 11 pass breakups). Langley played receiver at times in 2015, as well (4-51, TD). Southland Conference coaches voted him first-team all-conference as a cornerback and punt returner in his final year, as he intercepted six passes (tied for third nationally), broke up seven passes and scored twice on punt returns (21-245).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brendan-langley/32004c41-4e59-2094-56a2-9822843ceaa6

He got on the field right away, playing in all 13 games as a reserve (19 tackles) and setting a school record for freshmen with 4.5 sacks. Lee was a second-team All-Big 12 selection as a sophomore starter, leading the Wildcats with 80 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and accumulating five sacks and three interceptions on the season. He continued to be a team leader in his final year with the program, topping the charts with 110 tackles (6.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks), intercepting two passes in a first-team All-Big 12 junior season.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/elijah-lee/32004c45-4520-1855-b913-eb00539e3774
Damien Mama,"The Los Angeles metro area native was everybody's High School All-American on the offensive line, and kept his talents in town by signing with the Trojans. Mama became one of the first duo of true freshman starters in a Trojans' season opener with Toa Lobendahn, starting four games that season (two at left guard, two at right guard). He was a 2015 honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick at left guard after starting 13 of 14 games played, and won that starting job again in 12 of 13 games in 2016, earning second-team all-conference recognition by league coaches.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damien-mama/32004d41-4d05-9326-6ce5-16c8209b7acb
Matt Milano,"In recent years, Boston College football was known for the skill of its linebackers, from Luke Kuechly to Mark Herzlich. Milano, the 2012 Central Florida Defensive Player of the Year, took on that mantle the past two seasons for the Eagles after appearing in 25 games as a reserve his first two seasons on campus (23 tackles, three for loss). ACC media voted him honorable mention all-conference after his junior season where he had 60 tackles, a team-high 17.5 for loss and 6.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and two blocked kicks.

Jordan Morgan,"Morgan does not look like a Division II athlete. Listed at 6-foot-4, 320 pounds, the Philadelphia native has been overwhelming defenders since his redshirt freshman season, starting every game the past four seasons at left tackle. He started every game at left tackle in 2013, and then earned first-team All-Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference recognition in 2014. Morgan found national recognition with a spot on the Associated Press Little All-American squad as a junior, also earning the second of three consecutive first-team all-conference nods. Morgan again was in the national spotlight in 2016 as an AP Little All-American and a finalist for the Gene Upshaw Award for the top lineman in Division II.

Avery Moss,"Nebraska had high hopes for Moss when he arrived on campus, an All-Arizona pick in both football and basketball (he had 18 points, 21 rebounds, and four blocks in a state title game victory his senior year). His freshman season was derailed by a shoulder injury three games in, however. Moss heavily contributed the following year, starting three contests and making eight tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks, even scoring a touchdown on a 25-yard interception return. An off-field incident where he reportedly exposed himself to a fellow student caused him to be dismissed from campus, missing the 2014 football season. His former coach at Nebraska, Bo Pelini, gave him a second chance at Youngstown State the past two seasons. After taking a part-time role in 2015, (two starts, 4.5 TFL, 2.5 sacks), Moss earned a starting role across from fellow NFL draft prospect Derek Rivers. In 15 games he had 59 tackles, 17.5 for loss, 10.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles on his way to first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference accolades.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/avery-moss/32004d4f-5352-2777-800a-e5d2f21f74e0
Ifeadi Odenigbo,"Ifeadi Odenigbo (if-AH-dee o-DEN-uh-bo) came to Northwestern as one of the top recruits in the country, even though as the son of Nigerian immigrants he didn't participate in football until his sophomore year of high school. Statistically, Odenigbo made an impact as a pass-rushing specialist in his first three years, bringing down the quarterback 13.5 times among his 29 tackles in 36 games from 2013-2015. He may have made a similar impact as a true freshman in 2012, but redshirted after suffering a season-ending injury in the opener. Odenigbo bulked up for his senior year, allowing him to garner honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades (22 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, 10 sacks, two forced fumbles).

He's been a fixture there ever since he started three games in 2013. Orlosky started all 13 games in the middle in 2014, then received second-team All-Big 12 honors as a junior by performing well in every contest that season.

The nephew of famous rapper and Miami football booster Luther Campbell attempted to start his collegiate career with the University of Cincinnati, but did not play there. After one season with Copiah-Lincoln Community College (49 tackles, four sacks), Phillips transferred to Illinois, where he started three times in 12 games played in 2015 (26 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss, two sacks).

Ejuan Price,"""Juan"" Price has a shoe collection that would make former leaders in the Philippines jealous. That collection may go into the thousands of pairs if he has as much success in the NFL as he had rushing the passer for Pitt the past two seasons. Price started his career as an inside linebacker, starting five games there as a true freshman in 2011 (27 tackles, 6.5 for loss, four sacks). But then the injuries came. He redshirted 2012 with a pectoral injury, missed half of the 2013 season (23 tackles, four TFL in six games) with a back injury, and sat out another full season with a chest muscle malady in 2014. Finally healthy in his fifth year with the Panthers, Price had 48 tackles, 19.5 for loss, and led the ACC in sacks per game (0.88, 11.5 totals) gaining a first-team all-conference nod. Five of those sacks came in one game against Louisville. Price had 13 sacks again in another first-team All-ACC season this fall, and was also named second-team Walter Camp All-American by ranking second in the FBS with 23 tackles for loss (45 total stops).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ejuan-price/32005052-4914-9241-ec6d-467028165734
Jalen Reeves-Maybin,"Jalen's father, Marques Maybin, was a basketball player at Louisville but was paralyzed from the waist down after a car accident when Jalen was eight years old. Reeves-Maybin was a four-star linebacker recruit from Tennessee (2,000-plus rushing yards, all-state as a defender), and contributed as a true freshman as a reserve in 11 games (14 tackles, 11 on special teams). He stepped up to lead the Volunteers in tackles at weak-side linebacker as both a sophomore (101 tackles, 11 for loss, two sacks) and junior (105 tackles, 14 for loss, six sacks, four pass breakups). Reeves-Maybin's senior year, however, was a struggle. He was ejected for targeting in the season opener and then missed the bulk of the season with a shoulder injury, finishing with 20 tackles, two for loss.

Duke Riley,"The Bayou Bengals nearly lost out on signing Riley, as they offered him a grayshirt opportunity instead of a full initial scholarship. LSU came through with the scholly late in the process, and Riley signed on with his home-state team. Unfortunately for him, the Tigers' depth at linebacker kept him from playing significant minutes until his senior season. He played 39 games in his first three seasons, making seven tackles as a freshman, 20 tackles as a sophomore (starting one game that year), and then racking up 24 stops while waiting for his turn as a junior. Riley stuck with it, however, as he saw guys like Deion Jones (second-round pick for Atlanta in 2016) become NFL prospects with their patience. He started all 12 games as a senior, leading the squad with 93 tackles, nine for loss, 1.5 sacks and an interception.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/duke-riley/32005249-4c14-6648-2144-0e2e5abd5020
Derek Rivers,"Unlike his teammate, Avery Moss, Rivers started and ended his career with Youngstown, starring as a first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference selection each of the past three seasons. He spent a semester at Fork Union Military Academy first, as many east coast college hopefuls do instead of redshirting, then moved into a reserve role on defense for the Penguins in 2013 (13 tackles, three for loss, 2.5 sacks). The next season, he started to terrorize quarterbacks, making 50 tackles, 17 for loss, and 14 sacks (tied for fifth in the FCS) in 12 games. Rivers played defensive end and linebacker as a junior (52 tackles, 15.5 for loss, eight sacks) and then really turned it on with Moss across the way in 2016.

He also lost his grandmother to cancer and a younger brother to an accidental shooting. Roberts made his own way as a college student at Toledo, eventually getting eligible to play for the Golden Rockets. He played in five games as a reserve in 2013 (no catches) and nine contests the next year, seeing a bit more playing time (4-65, two TD). Coaches began relying on him in his junior year, starting him once in 12 games (21-234, four TD).

Coaches kept him at the left guard spot over the next two seasons, and he started all 24 games, earning honorable mention All-Mountain West honors in 2014 and second-team all-conference in 2015. Roullier then moved to center for his final season, garnering first-team all-conference accolades by snapping the ball to and protecting quarterback Josh Allen and blocking for star back Brian Hill.

After starring in football and track in high school, he went to Hargrave Military Academy in fall 2011, then attended Connecticut the following year (six yards on three carries in nine games). Williams did not play with the team in 2013 after being suspended in August of that year for credit card theft and illegal use. Moving on to ASA College in New York for the 2014 season, Williams rekindled interest from major programs after being named second-team NJCAA All-American (1,093 yards, seven TD in seven games).

He started 12 games there that season, and eight of 10 games played as a redshirt sophomore. He missed the end of his junior year with an injury, but still managed to win first-team All-Big South notice in his nine starts. The Georgia native gained national recognition as an Associated Press FCS All-American in 2016, as well as repeating as a first-team all-conference selection for his play on the blind side.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/erik-austell/32004155-5308-9265-3cf6-8531683890cc
Vince Biegel,"This two-time all-conference pick came from a football family. His father, Rocky, played linebacker at BYU while his uncle T.D. was a fullback for the Cougars. Vince's grandfather, Ken, played Division III ball and was a Wisconsin and national high school hall of fame coach. Coming from that lineage, it was no surprise Vince was the Wisconsin Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior (172 tackles, 21 sacks) and earned a scholarship to play for the Badgers. A foot injury ended his freshman season after two games, but he came on late the following year to start twice (25 tackles, three for loss, two sacks). Biegel led the Badgers with 16.5 tackles for loss (7.5 sacks) as a starter in 2014, and earned third-team All-Big Ten notice with 66 stops, 14 for loss, and eight sacks as a junior. Despite being limited for multiple games, missing two, with a broken foot, Biegel was a second-team All-Big Ten performer in 2016 (six TFL, four sacks).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vince-biegel/32004249-4532-8770-1f87-e70ee4709c76
Deyshawn Bond,"Four-year starter with a combination of core strength and foot quickness that lends itself to success on the interior. Smaller than desired with below average length and that could hurt his draft stock, but he's a plus in pass protection and decent in run blocking and could become an eventual starter with time.",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deyshawn-bond/3200424f-4e14-1472-e9d9-b6853e892d85
Kendrick Bourne,"Bourne and fellow draft prospect Cooper Kupp were the top receiving duo in FCS history. While Kupp deservedly received most of the headlines, Bourne was a three-time All-Big Sky Conference selection in his own right. He earned second-team all-league honors in 2015 (73-998, eight TD) and 2016 (79-1,201, seven TD) while playing on the Eagles' red turf. Bourne played right away as a freshman (7-117), with the Portland native coming off being named an All-Oregon pick his senior season. He then earned honorable mention All-Big Sky notice as a part-time starter in 2014 (52-814, 10 TD).",5.9,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kendrick-bourne/3200424f-5543-4790-acfc-7b92d77f3c8b
Tashawn Bower,"Developmental prospect with intriguing size and length. Bower's physical and athletic traits could make him a target for both 4-3 and 3-4 defenses, but he will need to prove he can find the quarterback more consistently if he wants to earn reps in the league. Bower was stuck behind a talented defensive front, but he flashes often enough to believe that he could develop into a better pro than college player.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tashawn-bower/3200424f-5717-2625-90a6-450d48505559
Christian Brown,Athletic defensive tackle who has been more solid than good. Brown lacks the size along the interior but does come off the ball with some quickness and has moldable attributes. Brown has enough ability to become a rotational interior defender if a team can help him iron out his pad-level issues.,5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-brown/32004252-4f34-2369-22d2-2f52b17ed7e8
KD Cannon,"KD O'Keith Cannon chose Baylor as a top-50 national recruit because of the receiver-friendly offense that then-head coach Art Briles ran in Waco. With the tumult in the program this offseason, the firing of Briles resulted in Cannon writing on Snapchat that ""you'll probably never see me in a Baylor uniform again."" Eventually he cooled off, deciding to finish his collegiate career with the Bears. The team was happy to have him back, as he played well enough to earn first-team All-Big 12 honors (87-1,215, 13 TDs). This was no surprise, since Cannon was a 1,000-yard receiver and honorable mention All-Big 12 and consensus Freshman All-American in his rookie year (seven starts, 58-1,030, eight TDs). Cannon's numbers were down a bit in 2015 (50-868, six TDs), although he was a second-team All-Big 12 pick after starting every game.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kd-cannon/32004341-4e61-2240-45c3-2631bdc858a2
Chris Carson,"Carson went the junior college route after a nice high school career in Georgia, signing with Butler Community College in Kansas and racking up over 1,600 yards and 17 scores in two years there. Though he led the Cowboys in rushing as a nine-game starter in 2015, his totals of 131 carries for 517 yards and four touchdowns (plus 17-170 receiving) weren't earth-shattering. Carson's senior year started off slow (12-45, TD in first two games) and then he missed four games with a thumb injury. He came on near the end of the year, though, finishing with 559 yards and nine touchdowns on just 82 carries, earning honorable mention All-Big 12 notice. Carson also caught 13 passes for 128 yards and a score in the nine games he played.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-carson/32004341-5256-8144-487d-eff74f49df34
Chuck Clark,"Clark is yet another tough-minded and athletic defensive back who has patrolled the secondary for the Hokies. One of the top players from Virginia in 2012, Clark stepped into a starting role as a true freshman in the team's bowl game, his second start of the year (22 tackles). Coaches lined him up at safety 11 times in the 13 games he played in 2014, making 73 tackles, 8.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, an interception and 11 pass break-ups on the year. The interception came in the team's Military Bowl win over Cincinnati. Clark started every game in 2015, being credited with 107 stops, three for loss, an interception, and eight pass break-ups. The Hokies' two-year team captain received honorable mention notice from league media in his final year, as he made 94 stops, 2.5 for loss, and two pass break-ups.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chuck-clark/3200434c-4122-5622-5c14-90fee339d2bb
Corey Clement,"It's been an up-and-down last couple of seasons for Clement. Expected to take over for first-round pick Melvin Gordon in 2015, Clement managed to play in just four games with one start (221 yards, 5 TD) due to a sports hernia. He also suffered a hand injury when punching someone in an elevator, and he lied to coaches and university staff about the incident initially. Clement bounced back in his senior year, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors (1,375 yards on 314 carries, 15 TD) as the full-time starter (missing one game due to an ankle injury). The four-star high school recruit from New Jersey showed promise early in his career as a back-up to Gordon (547 yards, 7 TD in 2013; 949 yards, 9 TD in 2014).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-clement/3200434c-4518-6218-e72b-31a350611a4e
Julie'n Davenport,"Davenport is the odds-on favorite to be the eighth offensive lineman from outside the FBS in the last ten drafts to be been selected in the top 100 picks. The cousin of former Kentucky and NBA player Michael Kidd-Gilchrist didn't have FBS offers coming out, but should have. He started all 44 games at left tackle in his career with Bucknell, earning all-conference honors each year (second team in 2013, first team from 2014-2016).

J.J Dielman,"One of the top offensive linemen in the Pac-12 couldn't find a place on the all-conference squad this season because a leg injury ended his senior year after five games. Dielman, the cousin of former NFL lineman Kris Dielman, was a team captain and started at center for the Utes in 2016 after starting all 26 games in 2014 and 2015 at the right tackle spot. J.J. (which stands for Jeffrey Joseph) was a second-team All-Pac-12 pick as a junior. The Arizona high school all-state pick redshirted his first year in Salt Lake City and played in one game as a reserve in 2013 before becoming a fixture on Utah's line.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/j-j-dielman/32004449-4535-3490-3608-93d8d8e63fe5
Jessamen Dunker,"As a four-star recruit that changed high schools as a senior for football reasons, great things were expected from Dunker when he signed with the University of Florida. He redshirted his first year in Gainesville, but an arrest for grand theft of a motor scooter made him decide to transfer in the following spring. Instead of sitting out a year at another FBS school, he went to Tennessee State, where he immediately grabbed the starting left tackle spot. Dunker started at left tackle and left guard in 2014, then received second-team All-Ohio Valley Conference notice as a junior for his work at left and right guard. He met high expectations as a senior, starting every game at left tackle again and grabbing first-team All-OVC and numerous FCS All-American honors in the process.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jessamen-dunker/32004455-4e46-2639-225e-79ffb09ca75f
Jake Eldrenkamp,"An athletic zone-scheme fit at guard or potentially center if he proves he can snap it. Eldrenkamp is technically sound in both the running and passing games and he's got desired body control and balance that zone teams like. The biggest question for him will be whether or not he can carry more mass, but the tape looks like that of a backup or possibly eventual starter if he can find the right scheme fit.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-eldrenkamp/3200454c-4455-0110-eebc-2fa1bf4db5d4
Amba Etta-Tawo,"There wasn't a lot of talk nationally about Etta-Tawo (pronounced ET-ta-TAH-wo) moving from Maryland to Syracuse as a graduate transfer this summer. Once the season started, however, his name was on the lips of most everyone in the college football world because he caught 47 passes for 834 yards and six scores in the team's first six games. He finished his senior season as a first-team All-ACC pick and ranked in the top ten nationally in all of the major receiving categories (94-1,482, 14 TD). The Georgia high school star started off his career at Maryland with a solid redshirt freshman season (31-500, two TD), but saw his contribution decrease the following two years (10-222, TD in 2014; 20-216, no scores in 2015).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/amba-etta-tawo/32004554-5408-7786-69fb-fd0e8e8fbf90
Nate Gerry,"In an unfortunate turn of events, Gerry was deemed ineligible for Nebraska's bowl game against Tennessee in the Music City Bowl on December 30th. He took responsibility for his mistake, apologizing for his lack of attention to his academics. Gerry always fulfilled his job duties on the field for the Cornhuskers, including in a 2016 regular season where he was named third-team All-Big Ten (68 tackles, 5.5 for loss, four interceptions and eight pass breakups.) He had been an honorable mention all-conference pick the previous two years (88 tackles, seven for loss, five INT in 2014; 79 tackles, four INT, seven PBU in 2015). Nebraska coaches got the South Dakota all-state pick and state 100-meter champion on the field right away in 2013, starting him three times at linebacker (32 tackles, two for loss).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-gerry/32004745-5265-0621-801d-5ee6a734a7d9
Zane Gonzalez,"Gonzalez finished his career in Tempe as the FBS record holder for most field goals made with 96 (previous record of 88 held by Dustin Hopkins from Florida State) out of 116 attempts, an 83 percent clip. He won first-team All-American and All-Pac-12 recognition as a senior by connecting on 23-of-25 field goal attempts, including seven-of-nine kicks from over 50 yards (his previous long was 49 yards). Gonzalez ranked second in the FBS with 26 field goal makes in 2015, including a conference-record six-field goal effort against Cal. He's also boomed 126-of-167 kickoffs (75 percent) for touchbacks over the past two seasons. The Texas native was a second-team All-Pac-12 honoree in 2014 (22-of-27 FG) and first-team all-conference pick as a true freshman (25-of-30 FG, school-record 138 points).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zane-gonzalez/3200474f-4e75-0924-5122-d295e60caad4
Tion Green,"When the rubber hits the road, Green is going to be more of a grinder than a creator as a runner. With that said, he does have good foot quickness and he's not a tight-hipped runner, so he might be a fit for a team looking for a big, one-cut runner. Green isn't going to make defenders miss that often, but he does flash some three-down potential and could make a 53-man roster if he can pull his weight on special teams.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tion-green/32004752-4536-4339-43e9-7a76b209a069
De'Angelo Henderson Sr.,"Henderson's career at Coastal got delayed a bit while the NCAA reviewed his academic eligibility. South Carolina's leading rusher in 2010 enrolled in 2011 and redshirted in 2012. Since then, he's set most of the school rushing records and several NCAA marks, despite missing three games in 2016 with a shoulder injury. He scored in 35 straight games, setting the Division I record by falling just shy of Danny Woodhead's NCAA All-Division mark that he set at Chadron State. Henderson started four of 15 games played as a freshman (82-599, six TD rushing; 4-39 receiving) before breaking out in 2014. He was a first-team All-Big South pick that year, ranking ninth in the FCS in rushing yards and seventh in rushing scores (234-1,534, 20 TD rushing; 33-289, TD receiving). Henderson was a third-team Associated Press All-American in 2015, as well as Big South Offensive Player of the Year, with 1,346 yards on 222 carries and 16 touchdowns rushing (40-403, three TD receiving). His totals were down a bit in 2016 because of the injury (183-1,156, 16 TD rushing; 20-190, two TD receiving), though he set career highs in rushing yards per game (128.4).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/de-angelo-henderson-sr/32004845-4e05-4848-5be1-eb8e3f08802a
Cole Hikutini,"Even Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson need safety valves to keep the offense moving. Hikutini (hick-uh-TEE-nee) was just that the past two years, especially in 2016 when he was a second-team All-ACC pick, leading the team in receptions (50) and receiving touchdowns (eight) and second in yards (668). Hikutini only played one year of high school football, so he flew under recruiting radars. He began his career at Sacramento State, redshirting his first year and starting four games in 2013 (21-204, five TD). To get noticed by FCS schools, he transferred to City College of San Francisco for one year, where he shined (40-658, four TD). That led to Louisville signing him, and utilizing him regularly in his first year with the Cardinals (19-348, three TD).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cole-hikutini/32004849-4b65-2601-ef7c-3f62f188ac3c
Lano Hill,"Delano and his younger brother, Lavert, played on the same football team for the first time in 2016. They attended different high schools in Detroit, with Delano going to Cass Technical and Lavert, a top 10 cornerback recruit, to Martin Luther King. Delano saved his best season for when his brother arrived, receiving second-team All-Big Ten notice as a senior (52 tackles, 4.5 for loss, three interceptions, three pass breakups.) The depth of Michigan's secondary kept Hill off the field as a freshman in 2013 (one tackle), but he fought his way into the starting lineup five times the following year (20 tackles) despite his missing time in preseason with a broken jaw and a few midseason games with a leg injury.

A four-star recruit from Weston, Florida, he redshirted his first year on campus to get stronger and then missed the first 10 games of the 2013 season due to a foot injury. Isidora grabbed the starting spot for the start of the 2014 season and did not relinquish it through the rest of his career.

Blake Jarwin,"Oklahoma State instituted a new ""Cowboy"" position in their offense in 2015, a hybrid fullback/tight end position that has become more popular in college and NFL football. Jarwin filled that role each of the last two seasons admirably. He failed to get on the field as a redshirt freshman walk-on in 2013 and then contributing at the tight end spot in 2014 (two starts, 5-107, one TD). Jarwin was a first-team All-Big 12 pick as a junior, catching 17 passes for 200 yards and two scores despite missing time with a rib injury.

The two-time team captain contributed as a freshman (14 tackles) before getting into the starting line-up in 2014 (101 tackles, 12 for loss, four sacks).

T.J. Logan,"Teammate Elijah Hood received most of the headlines for the Tar Heels' running game the past few seasons, but Logan's contributions were not overlooked by NFL scouts. Considered one of the top all-purpose running back recruits out of high school, Logan lived up to that reputation during his career in Chapel Hill. He started four of nine games played as a true freshman (93-533, four TDs rushing; 10-124 receiving), and had 511 yards on just 19 kick returns, including two touchdowns. Logan was a nine-game starter in 2014, rushing for 582 yards and three touchdowns on 119 carries as well as contributing as a receiver (26-144) and kick returner (16-405). Hood prevented Logan from starting a game in his junior year, but he still provided an offensive spark when given a chance (66-416, five TDs rushing; 11-151, one TD receiving; 21-492 kick returns). Logan was rewarded by league media in 2016 for his outstanding work as an all-purpose player (120-675, seven TDs rushing; 29-244, three TDs receiving; 21-690, two TDs on kick returns).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-logan/32004c4f-4776-5234-e831-0a4eaf2326f1

The 5-foot-8, 175-pound playmaker has given scouts something to think about, as he proved to be a valuable offensive weapon as a junior.

Muhammad looked the part as a true freshman, playing as a reserve in all 13 games (eight tackles, two sacks). He also showed promise in 2015, making 54 tackles and leading the Hurricanes with 8.5 tackles for loss and five sacks.

Levon Myers,"Athletic prospect with potential roster flexibility that could push him up some draft boards. While Myers has the movement ability to play guard in a zone scheme, some teams may also view him as a legitimate swing tackle with the athleticism and length to play either tackle spot. Myers moves well, but he's not a finesse player.

Ogunbowale (whose name is pronounced DAR-ay oh-goon-bo-WALL-ay) came to Wisconsin as a walk-on defensive back. He redshirted in 2012 and played in eight games on special teams in 2013. Ogunbowale moved from cornerback to running back after the first game of the 2014 season due to injuries there (34-193, TD) and was also the team's second-leading special teams tackler with nine. With Corey Clement not playing much in 2015, Ogunbowale started 10 games and led the team in rushing (194-819, seven TD rushing; 36-299, TD receiving).

Pumphrey beat the record in his final game, finishing off an All-American season where he led with nation with 2,133 rushing yards on 349 carries (tied for most in FBS) and 17 scores (along with 27-231 receiving). He won the Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year this fall, repeating the honor he was given in 2015 for covering 1,653 yards and scoring 17 touchdowns on 309 carries. He also led the Aztecs with 28 receptions, accumulating 416 yards and three scores. Pumphrey set a school record with 1,867 yards while scoring 20 times as a sophomore, earning the first of three first-team All-Mountain West accolades.

Austin Rehkow,"Rehkow (pronounced ree-CO) is one of a handful of specialists in the country in recent years that have handled both kicking and punting duties for their teams. The only reason Rehkow wasn't a four-time first-team all-conference pick as a punter was because Idaho was an independent in his freshman year (led FBS with 47.8 yards per punt, 24 inside the 20 yard-line, 15 fair catches). He was a Ray Guy Award finalist and third-team Associated Press All-American in 2014 (second in FBS with 47.8  yards per punt, 17 inside the 20) and then had an excellent junior season, as well (45.7 per punt, 14 of 49 inside the 20). As a senior, Rehkow had his worst gross average (41.6) but placed 26 of 56 punts inside the 20 with only three touchbacks. He also excelled as a kicker, making 26 of 29 attempts to earn his second straight second-team All-Sun Belt honor. This was not a big surprise, since he made a 67-yard field goal (one off the national record) in high school. Rehkow kicked extra point for four years (127-130) and made 70 of 92 (76.1 percent) of his career field goal attempts. He was the team's kickoff specialist for four years, as well, putting 96 of 254 attempts for touchbacks.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-rehkow/32005245-4843-9587-109a-76920d68a50e
Darreus Rogers,"Rogers was a high school All-American from the Los Angeles area (64-1,251, 10 TD as a senior) that stayed home to play for the Trojans. He grayshirted in 2012, enrolling at USC in the spring of 2013 to participate in practices (though he missed time with shoulder and hamstring injuries). Rogers played in 11 games as a freshman (missing three with a right ankle injury), catching 22 passes for 257 yards. He played in 13 games, starting three (21-245, four TDs) in 2014 and then took a stronger role as a junior (11 starts, 28-289, three TDs) while again missing games with a hamstring injury. Rogers finally stayed healthy throughout his senior season, garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice after finishing second on the team with 56 catches for 696 yards and four scores.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darreus-rogers/3200524f-4719-9422-14df-75db6bb332cb
Justin Senior,"This Montreal, Quebec native was the number one-ranked prospect on the Canadian Football League's official Scouting List in December 2016. Senior has been a staple for the Bulldogs over the past three seasons, starting nearly every game at the right tackle spot (missed one game in 39 with a 2015 knee injury). Even as a redshirt freshman, Senior got on the field for 11 games, starting one at his strong-side tackle position. Before his redshirt season, he transitioned from Canadian high school football to the American version by playing one fall at the Hargrave Military Academy.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-senior/32005345-4e17-2313-5683-9db4be069e1e
Garrett Sickels,"Penn State has had a pipeline into New Jersey for years, and picking up a two-time all-Jersey selection in Sickels was another great recruiting move by the Nittany Lions. As a redshirt freshman, Sickels played in every game as a reserve end and on special teams (11 tackles, three TFL, two sacks). Making the starting lineup in 2015, he contributed 35 tackles, five for loss, three sacks, and led the team with two fumble recoveries. He made a big leap from his sophomore to junior seasons, garnering second-team All-Big Ten honors with 47 tackles and leading PSU with 12.5 tackles for loss and six sacks.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garrett-sickels/32005349-4333-1964-e8d7-cfd538349f72
Jamari Staples,"Staples is one of dozens of players who were displaced when Alabama-Birmingham shut down its football program after the 2014 season -- a program which they already plan on re-starting. This Alabama native took advantage of the situation, though, going to play with the Cardinals the past two seasons. He played in 21 games, starting 12, in his true freshman (31-458, four TD) and sophomore (9-190, one TD) seasons at UAB. He was allowed to transfer to the 'Ville for the 2015 season, and he caught 37 passes for 638 yards and three scores even though he missed the first four games of the year with a knee injury. Staples started 11 games as a senior, catching 36 passes for 615 yards and two touchdowns.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamari-staples/32005354-4149-5255-2ae0-ad2a4532ed4b
Channing Stribling,"Stribling grew up in basketball country in North Carolina, and could have played hoops at Liberty University. But the call to the Big House was too much to pass up. He didn't get on the field a lot in his first couple of seasons, playing in seven games as a freshman (one start, 16 tackles) and then as a reserve in 10 contests (seven tackles) in 2014. Stribling started four games as a junior, making 17 tackles and collecting an interception and a pass break-up against Florida in the Citrus Bowl. That performance buoyed his senior season, as he earned second-team All-Big Ten accolades (28 tackles, 3.5 for loss, led team with four INT and 13 PBU) forming a strong starting duo with Jourdan Lewis.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/channing-stribling/32005354-5233-4328-57c6-a81b62880d12
Ryan Switzer,"While Switzer is not related to the famous college and NFL head coach of the same surname, Barry Switzer did reach out to the family by phone to see if there was any relation. The two-time West Virginia Gatorade High School Player of the Year was mostly known for his rushing ability (2,379 yards, 32 TD as a senior), but became well-regarded as a receiver and returner during his time in Chapel Hill. Switzer won several All-American and Freshman All-American awards in 2013, as well as first-team All-ACC notice as a specialist, because he tied the NCAA record of five punt returns for touchdowns (24-502, nation-best 20.9 average). He also got his beak wet as a receiver that year (32-341, three TD), though his contributions there increased as a sophomore (61-762, four TD; 37-172 on punt returns). Switzer earned All-American honors again for his punt returns in 2015 (22-302, two TD) but also picked up third-team All-ACC recognition after leading the Tar Heels in receiving (55-697, six TD). His accomplishments as a receiver outweighed those for his return skills (16-106) in his senior year. League coaches named him first-team All-ACC as a receiver in 2016 because he finished tenth in the country with 96 receptions for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-switzer/32005357-4974-9216-55ce-2acba910db49
Damarius Travis,"Damarius Travis and Damarious Randall were teammates on a state championship team in Florida, and now Travis hopes to join Randall, a first round pick of the Green Bay Packers, in the NFL. His play as a senior helped his cause, as he earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors from league media by leading the Gophers with 83 tackles, five for loss, intercepting two passes and breaking up five others. This was the type of year the team expected from Travis in 2015, but after starting the opener that year, making 10 tackles in the game, he was lost for the year with a hamstring injury. Travis' star started to shine in 2014, when he started seven games, producing 61 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions and five pass breakups. He also contributed as a freshman (eight tackles in 13 games) and sophomore (two starts, 28 stops, four PBU) in Minnesota.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damarius-travis/32005452-4149-6610-5c43-b5230018a124
Jylan Ware,"A prospect with the traits and athleticism to potentially advance more quickly than others with the developmental label. While his pass sets need work, he seems to have a good feel for how to use his long arms and strong hands.

Davis Webb,"Webb has been on both sides of the quarterback depth chart battle during his four years in college. The Texas native signed up to play for then-new head coach Kliff Kingsbury's wide-open offense at Texas Tech. He ended up taking the reins of that offense halfway through his true freshman season, unseating future two-year Heisman Trophy finalist Baker Mayfield (who moved on to Oklahoma the next year) in the process. He played in 10 games, starting six, that year, completing 62.6 percent of his passes for 2,718 yards and 20 touchdowns, with nine interceptions. Webb started eight games the following year (2,539 yards, 24 TD, 13 INT, 61.2 completion pct), but lost the job to Patrick Mahomes. He played in just five games the next year as Mahomes' back-up (22-of-41, 300 yards, two TD, zero INT), leading to his decision to transfer as a graduate student. He initially agreed to go to Colorado but eventually switched to Cal to replace the number one pick in the 2016 draft, Jared Goff. Webb started all 12 games for the Bears, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors (4,295 yards, 37 TD, 12 INT, 61.6 completion pct.)",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davis-webb/32005745-4210-7865-aa79-d1694a1e3e3a
Chad Wheeler,"A move blocker with the ability to operate confidently in space while lacking the power to whip the man across from him. Lack of core strength and consistent footwork in pass protection could force him to make a move inside to guard for a zone team.

Marquez White,"A two-sport athlete, White played with the basketball Seminoles for six games in the 2013-2014 season. He quickly decided, however, that football was his best future profession. White was primarily played as a reserve and special teamer in 25 games in 2013 (12 tackles) and 2014 (three tackles). He earned a starting spot for all 13 games as a junior (25 tackles, two for loss, one interception, and two pass breakups). White was also a 13-game starter and honorable mention All-ACC from league media pick in 2016, intercepting two passes and breaking up four passes.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marquez-white/32005748-4936-3802-37ac-07a697fbd9d8
Jamaal Williams,"Williams led the Cougars in rushing in all four seasons in which he played, even though he has had off-field and injury issues during his time in Provo. The all-state pick from California played immediately as a true freshman, starting eight games and rushing for 755 yards and 12 touchdowns on 166 carries. He also added 315 yards and a touchdown on 27 receptions. Williams was an FBS All-Independent team pick as the full-time starter in 2013, gaining 1,233 yards and scoring seven times on 217 totes (18-125 receiving). His junior season was derailed by a knee injury and suspension for multiple team code violations, including an underage drinking citation. He rushed for 518 yards and four scores in seven games that year, still leading the team in rushing. Williams sat out the 2015 season entirely after withdrawing from school for personal reasons, always intending to return for his senior season the following fall. He carried the mail for the Cougars 234 times in 2016, accumulating 1,375 yards and scoring 12 times, though he missed three games with an ankle injury. He finished fifth in the country with 137.5 yards per game last fall, in part thanks to a 287-yard, five-touchdown effort against Toledo before the ankle injury occurred.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamaal-williams/32005749-4c32-8269-4a19-d851ac99ba3c
Ishmael Zamora,"Before the 2016 season, a video was released that showed Zamora beating his dog with a belt. A former Baylor student took the video to the Baylor Police Department, and Waco police charged him with misdemeanor animal abuse. He was suspended for three games by the team, cited by police with a fine, completed 40 hours of community service and lost his dog to an animal-friendly home. Zamora is an incredible athlete that excelled late in his high school career on the gridiron and on the track, winning a state championship in the 110-meter hurdles as a junior. He redshirted with the Bears in 2014 and played on occasion during his freshman year (9-132, two TDs receiving; 5-142 on kick returns). Zamora finished second on the team with 63 receptions for 809 yards and eight touchdowns in 2016.

FIU fired Cristobal after the 2012 season, and Brown (eight tackles, two TFL, 1.5 sacks in 10 games with the Panthers) decided to leave the school as well. Ole Miss won the recruiting battle, though Brown was forced to redshirt in 2013 as a transfer student. He started nine games in 2014, making 38 tackles, with 5.5 going for losses. Brown started eight games as a junior, leading the team with 10 quarterback hurries (32 tackles, 4.5 TFL, sack).

Jamal Carter,"Being one of the top safety recruits in the country out of Miami's Southridge High School, it was natural for him to sign with the Hurricanes. Depth in the secondary caused him to be a bit player in his first two years (six tackles in 2013; two starts, 26 tackles, five pass breakups as a sophomore). Carter only started once in 2015, as well, but he played regularly enough for scouts to see his athleticism and physicality (49 tackles, INT, two PBU).

Clark impressed them with the way he began his senior season, starting the first three games (10 tackles, two pass break-ups) before tearing his left ACL in the fourth game of the year. He attempted to get a sixth year of eligibility but was denied by the NCAA because he redshirted the 2012 season without an injury. The Kentucky all-state high school pick played in seven games as a redshirt freshman safety in 2013 (no statistics) before earning six starts there in 12 games the following year (18 tackles, one pass defended). A shoulder injury prevented him from starting in the second half of that season.

Ethan Cooper,"Poor grades and a poor physique cost Cooper scholarship offers coming out of high school. But his work ethic changed during his early college days, resulting in some legitimate NFL interest. He played in six games at guard as a true freshman, starting three of the last four contests of the year. Cooper started all 11 games inside as a sophomore, earning second-team All-Pennsylvania Scholastic Athletic Conference West Division honors.

He moved to that position midway through his freshman year, when he played in all but one game and made three special teams tackles. Daniels played in 11 games as a sophomore, starting four and catching 11 passes for 171 yards and a touchdown. He caught 19 passes as a part-time starter in 2015 (eight of 13 games played), running for 250 yards and a score.

Treston Decoud,"The cousin of former Cal and NFL safety Thomas Decoud had a rougher road on his way to college football notoriety. He didn't have the academic scores to go to a FBS program out of high school, so he signed with Division II Chadron State (Nebraska). He played in 10 ten games as a redshirt freshman (four tackles) in 2013 but decided to move closer to home after his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. He intended to play at Nicholls State, but could not get eligibility there, so he played at Northwest Mississippi Community College -- where he was a first-team All-American after picking off six passes on the year. Decoud started nine games in his first year with the Beavers (50 tackles, five pass breakups) though he missed two with a concussion.

One of the most intelligent (aerospace engineering major) and likeable players in college football, Dobbs did perform well at times in his senior year, racking up 2,946 yards and 27 touchdowns through the air and 831 yards with 12 scores on the ground. His 12 interceptions set a career high, however. Dobbs started all 13 games for the first time in his career as a junior (2,291 yards, 15 TD, five INT passing; 671 yards, 11 TD rushing), which followed a strong sophomore campaign where he was named the TaxSlayer.com Bowl MVP after accumulating 205 yards of offense and three scores against Iowa.

Elliott, however, did just that for the Tigers, becoming the school's all-time leading scorer as well as setting records for field goals made in total and from 50 yards away or more. This at a school that produced New England Patriots All-Pro Stephen Gostkowski. Elliott made 21-of-26 field goals in 2016, was also an Academic All-American just one year after being named an AP All-American (and Lou Groza Award finalist) for on-the-field play (23-of-28 FG). He started his career with a bang in 2013, going 16-for-18 on field goal attempts including three from 50 yards or more. Elliott had a sophomore slump (21-of-32 FG, 6-of-16 from over 40 yards), but did not miss an extra point throughout his career, making 202 straight.

Ford made five tackles in that first season, then jumped to a starting role at safety in 2014, topping all Tigers with 93 stops (2.5 TFL) and intercepting three passes. Coaches moved him between nickel and safety in 2015, and he again led the team with 118 tackles (3.5 TFL) while intercepting two more throws. Ford again played nickel as a senior, making fewer stops (59 tackles, 5.5 for loss) but more of a factor in coverage (seven pass breakups).",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rudy-ford/3200464f-5232-3002-26e9-480b503f60cb

He then went on his two-year church mission to Tampa, Florida, and upon his return decided to transfer to in-state rival Brigham Young. Langi played in 12 games, starting one, as a defensive end and linebacker for the Cougars in 2014 (14 tackles). He moved into the starting lineup at linebacker in 2015 (68 tackles, 6.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, two interceptions) and followed that up with a solid senior year (57 stops, five TFL, two sacks).",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/harvey-langi/32004c41-4e58-5903-7fd5-e0073eb48b32
Corey Levin,"Levin's father, Grant, played collegiate golf at Florida International. Corey's size and strength probably allow him to bang the ball off the tee, but his professional future likely lies on another field of grass. After a strong high school career in Georgia, Levin redshirted his first year in Chattanooga before not only winning the starting job as a freshman, but earning Southern Conference All-Freshman notice. The next two seasons, Levin started all 27 games, splitting time between left tackle and left guard, and was named the Jacobs Blocking Trophy winner as SoCon's top offensive lineman each year. He was a second-team Associated Press All-American as a junior and senior, and was also a first-team All-SoCon pick in 2016 holding down the left guard spot in every contest.",5.8,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-levin/32004c45-5658-4781-eaee-52a98f2b3ef9
Erik Magnuson,"One of the better right tackles in the nation, Magnuson finished his career with the Wolverines with a first-team All-Big Ten season, starting every game for the Wolverines. He garnered third-team all-conference notice as a junior, his first starting outside (12 games). A West Coast kid (Carlsbad, CA), Magnuson redshirted his first year in the Midwest. After building strength that year, Magnuson played in 12 games as a sophomore, starting seven at right guard. He had shoulder surgery before 2014, but still managed to start five of eight games played at left guard and line up as a blocking tight end on six-man fronts.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/erik-magnuson/32004d41-4763-2910-3de1-fab5c4fcf5c4
Gabe Marks,"Marks set the Pac-12 record for most career receptions in his senior year, also finishing second in conference history with 37 touchdown catches and seventh with 3,453 receiving yards. While not the biggest receiver at six feet, 190 pounds, Marks may be the hardest-working. He had the pedigree coming to Pullman, a four-star recruit and All-Area pick in the Los Angeles area as a high schooler. Marks played in every game as a true freshman, starting seven (49-560, two TDs). He started the first nine games of the 2013 season, playing in all 13 contests (74-807, seven TDs). His contributions dwindled at the end of the year, however, and he had a couple of run-ins with local police. Head coach Mike Leach decided to redshirt Marks for the 2014 season to install some maturity. Apparently the break worked, as Marks was a first-team All-Pac-12 selection as a junior, starting every game and catching 104 passes (ranked fifth in the FBS) for 1,192 yards and 15 scores (fourth in the FBS). He repeated the first-team all-conference honor in 2016, though his numbers were down slightly (89-894, 13 TDs).",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gabe-marks/32004d41-5225-3345-bc1c-abbac8c34b03
Elijah McGuire,"The son of the late Elijah McGuire, Sr. (who passed away when Elijah was just 12 years old) led the state of Louisiana in rushing as a senior with 2,603 yards while also throwing for 497 yards and five scores. Since signing on with the Ragin' Cajuns as a running back, he's racked up over 4,000 career yards. He was the Sun Belt Conference's Freshman of the Year in 2013 and first-team all-conference pick (863 yards, eight TD rushing; 22-384, 3 TD receiving), leading the FBS with an average of 8.4 yards per carry. McGuire was named the conference Player of the Year the following season with 1,264 rushing yards (7.6 per carry), 14 scores, and 45 catches for 468 yards and two touchdowns. His numbers were down a bit in his junior year (210-1,058, 13 TD rushing; 33-293, three TD receiving) but he still earned honorable mention All-Sun Belt notice. McGuire set a career high with 232 carries as a senior (1,168 yards, seven TD) and made plays as a receiver (29-238, two TD), so he was recognized as a second-team all-conference selection. McGuire has also returned punts at times over the past three seasons (career totals of 28-197).",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/elijah-mcguire/32004d43-4779-1501-54ab-0fdf2b3b0578
Charmeachealle Moore,"Moore isn't the biggest linebacker out there but he plays with bright eyes and consistent intensity. Moore has experience playing inside and outside but may be best suited as a weakside linebacker in a 4-3. His draft stock could swing on his athletic testing, but his instincts and playing style should give him a head-start with a position coach who appreciates his approach. Moore could be an early practice squad candidate.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charmeachealle-moore/32004d4f-4f22-5653-8fcc-502ae15d5a47
Drew Morgan,"Has adequate size to give a team some snaps from an outside receiver spot, but the slot may be his final home. Morgan wins with crisp routes and sticky hands and there is plenty of tape showing the toughness to finish catches despite taking big hits. Morgan has the talent to earn a roster spot and work his way up the ladder, but he needs to show off good quickness numbers and adequate speed during his combine workout.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/drew-morgan/32004d4f-5216-1656-2bba-6bbbfdbc4bc0
Jalen Myrick,"The last two seasons, Myrick has not gained enough votes among league coaches or media members to achieve more than honorable mention status. However, scouts know that his game is a good fit for the NFL. The former Georgia state runner-up in the 100 meters came up big for the Gophers as a senior, making 41 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and leading the squad with 12 passes defensed (one interception, 11 pass breakups). He had a bit of a scare in his junior year, suffering a collapsed lung while being tackled on a kick return (1,052 career yards, one score as a returner). Myrick wound up playing in 10 games and starting seven that year (27 tackles, seven TFL, two PBU). He contributed mostly on special teams in his first season in Minnesota (four tackles) before getting significant playing time as a reserve corner the following year (21 tackles, one for loss, seven pass breakups) -- Myrick even returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown that season.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-myrick/32004d59-5217-4507-3812-d184b57c2659
Storm Norton,"It might surprise some to know that Toledo had the seventh-best offense in the country based on yardage (517.8 per game) and ranked in the top twenty nationally in scoring (38 points per contest). A lot of that had to do with the protection Norton gave to quarterback Logan Woodside and the holes he made for running back Kareem Hunt during the season. He started every game the past two seasons at left tackle, earning first-team All-MAC recognition each season. An all-state pick from Toledo, Norton stayed home and worked hard to get stronger during his first couple of seasons with the Rockets. He played in seven games as a redshirt freshman, and then took over the left tackle spot with three games to go in the 2014 season.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/storm-norton/32004e4f-5276-3430-a5bf-58da8f72529d
James Onwualu,"Notre Dame has had good success with players from Cretin-Durham High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota; Onwualu (on-WALL-ew) joined receiver Michael Floyd, linebacker Marcus Freeman, and offensive tackle Ryan Harris in matriculating to South Bend from this school. Onwualu began his career at Floyd's position, actually starting four games in 12 games played, but only catching two passes. He had six special teams tackles, though, which led to a switch to linebacker, where he started eight games in 2014 (24, two for loss). Onwualu made 38 tackles, six for loss with three sacks as a nine-game starter as a junior. He set career bests in tackles (76) and tackles for loss (11.5) as a senior team captain, also being credited with three sacks.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-onwualu/32004f4e-5763-9851-e9ab-d888f21e56e5
Scott Orndoff,"Orndoff, the son of a former USFL player by the same name, has the genetics to contribute in the NFL, just as he has the past two seasons with the Panthers. An intriguing high school recruit, he started five of nine games in his freshman season (6-50, 2 TD) before injuring his knee. That injury caused him to see less playing time the following year (no starts, 4-24, one score). Orndoff's production increased with the health of his knee in 2015, allowing him to finish second on the team with five receiving touchdowns (13-244, 18.8 yards per catch). He became a big part of the offense in his final season, catching 35 passes (second-most on the team) for 579 yards (16.5 per) and five touchdowns.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/scott-orndoff/32004f52-4e09-1071-5dad-70b5cb764425
Adam Pankey,"It's unusual for an offensive lineman to excel in three different positions during his collegiate career. Pankey accomplished that feat, however, after winning second-team All-Big 12 honors at right guard in his senior season. The All-Ohio high school selection redshirted in 2012 and then in played eight games as a reserve in his freshman season with the Mountaineers. Coaches started him at left tackle for all 13 games in 2014, and then started 12 at left guard (missing two due to an ankle injury) as a junior. Versatility to play nearly everywhere on the line will be valued by NFL scouts.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/adam-pankey/32005041-4e65-3214-9010-07b07a6defd0
Aarion Penton,"Penton's had his issues off the field, reportedly cited twice for marijuana possession in 2014. On the field, though, he's been the Tigers' best cornerback since the departure of E.J. Gaines. Penton was a first-team All-SEC selection in 2016, which is quite an accomplishment given the level of defensive back talent in that conference; he made 43 tackles on the year and led the SEC with 17 passes defended (five interceptions, one for TD, and 12 pass breakups). Penton won Missouri's award for the team's top cornerback in 2015 by registering 59 stops, 4.5 for loss, an interception and eight pass breakups. He was a full-time starter as a sophomore (36 tackles, two TFL, three INT) after being an injury replacement for Gaines as a true freshman (two starts, 16 tackles, one INT, two PBU.) Penton was born with the last name Maxey, but had it changed to Maxey-Penton a few years ago to honor his stepfather and had just Penton on his jersey for most of his career.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aarion-penton/32005045-4e78-0192-e767-4a9ba8ca5191
Devine Redding,"Devine's father, Desmond, played football at Fresno City College before a knee injury ended his career. He helped his son become a solid high school back at vaunted Glenville High School, but Indiana was his only scholarship offer through most of the recruiting process. The Hoosiers got a good back in Redding, who was the first back since Vaughn Dunbar in 1990-91 to have back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2016 (253-1,122, seven TDs rushing; 27-146, two TDs receiving), one season after reaching four digits in rushing as a sophomore (226-1,012, nine TDs rushing; 12-85 receiving). In his first season with the program, he played in 10 games (29-118, one TD).",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devine-redding/32005245-4432-8012-9757-3bd31d2b8156
Sam Rogers,"All you need to know about Rogers is that in his junior year of high school, he dislocated his elbow. Instead of sitting on the sideline for the rest of the season, he moved to linebacker and tight end for the rest of the year. He was a walk-on for Tech in 2013, but he ended up playing in every game and starting two (5-9 rush, 12-78 receiving). Rogers again played in every game, starting six and contributing on offense (32-140 rushing; 20-230, one TD receiving) and special teams (11 tackles). His offensive contributions increased in 2015 (61-260, two TDs rushing; 16-193, two TDs receiving), and rose again in his senior year (67-284, two TDs rushing; 24-301, four TDs receiving) as the Hokies grew to rely on his playmaking skills.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sam-rogers/3200524f-4753-3114-d518-e21dc2b713d6
Dan Skipper,"Even among the big-bodied tackles in the SEC, the 6-foot-10 Skipper stands out. That size has served him well at Arkansas, where he's started each game since the midway point of his true freshman season. Skipper lined up at guard the last eight games of that season, and he also used his height to set a school record with three blocked field goals. He moved from guard to left tackle for his sophomore year, also changing his jersey number to put costly penalties in the past. Skipper started all 39 games at the left tackle spot since 2014, earning second-team All-SEC notice as a junior and a first-team all-conference nod in his senior season.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dan-skipper/3200534b-4966-5077-ebc9-d97ab1242a87
Fish Smithson,"Smithson's brother, Shaky, was a receiver at the University of Utah, so he went to high school in Salt Lake City to escape a difficult life in Baltimore. Anthony ""Fish"" Smithson was a high school quarterback that went to tiny Hartnell College out of high school; he led the Coast Conference with eight interceptions in that season. He went to Kansas for the 2014 season, playing in 12 games as a key reserve (49 tackles, two for loss). Smithson garnered second-team All-Big 12 accolades as a junior, leading the nation with 7.9 solo tackles per contest and the Big 12 with 111 total tackles (along with two interceptions and five pass breakups). Fish led his team in tackles again in 2016 with 93 (2.5 for loss) as a first-team All-Big 12 selection.

Grover Stewart,"Stewart's girth, power and potential could lead a team to take him on the third day as a developmental run-stuffer capable of playing on the nose or at three-technique. Stewart is still very raw, but additional technique work could unleash a much more capable interior defender as he has the traits. The jump in competition will take some time to adjust to, but like other small school interior defenders before him, Stewart has the potential to work himself into a more prominent role within the first two or three years.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/grover-stewart/32005354-4575-7436-dbba-86ad2a2f4b3a
Pita Taumoepenu,"Pita Taumoepenu (peet-tuh tao-mo-eh-pen-new) was born in Texas, his family moved to Tonga when he was three (where he learned to play rugby), and eventually made his way to Provo, Utah to be an all-state pick with 25 sacks as a senior. The NCAA had some issues with the splitting of his high school career between two countries, but he wound up playing in seven games as a freshman in 2013, making six tackles, two for loss, and a sack on defense and special teams. Taumoepenu flourished as a pass-rush specialist for the next three years, starting with a 17-tackle, 5.5-sack effort as a sophomore. He had just nine tackles in 13 games as a junior, but six of them were quarterback takedowns. Earning four starts in 11 games in 2016, Taumoepenu had 34 tackles, nine for loss, and seven sacks (including three against Arizona State).",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/pita-taumoepenu/32005441-5521-7769-5153-af03b1c08fe6
Trent Taylor,"It is best not to underestimate Taylor because of his lack of size. Only one FBS scholarship offer came his way because of his 5-foot-8, 178-pound frame, but Louisiana Tech has been the beneficiary of their foresight. The Shreveport product played as a true freshman despite his size, both as a receiver and on special teams (28-260, two TD; 6-53 punt returns). Taylor was a second-team All-Conference USA selection in 2014, becoming a focus in the passing game (64-834, nine TD) and making plays as a returner (22-168 on punts). He was a first-team all-conference pick as the team's leading receiver his junior year, making 99 receptions (third-most in the FBS) for 1,282 yards and nine scores. Taylor again was a first-team All-C-USA player as senior, catching an incredible 136 throws in 14 games for the Bulldogs for a nation-leading 1,803 yards and 12 touchdowns. His reception total ranked only behind East Carolina receiver Zay Jones' record-breaking 158 grabs. Taylor also returned punts his final two seasons (13-83 in 2015; 17-178 in 2016), a skill he'll likely get a chance to show in the NFL.",5.6,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trent-taylor/32005441-5975-8512-56a9-70ba428be183

Thomas started five of 12 games played in 2014, leading the team with four receiving touchdowns on his 26 receptions that went for 305 yards. He was the Huskies' top receiver as a junior (54-719, three TDs) before breaking out during a senior campaign that saw him set the school record with 100 receptions.

He almost lost his right to complete his football career, however, after being charged with assault at a campus party in Boulder. That action cost him the entire 2015 season. Scouts were excited to see him that year after he garnered honorable mention All-Pac12 honors in 2014 (29 tackles, four for loss, three sacks). He had dropped 25 pounds before the 2013 season, and he started 12 games that year (34 tackles, three TFL), just one season after playing through a sprained ankle with the extra weight as a true freshman in 2012 (16 tackles, 4.5 TFL).

The Nigerian native (his father was the country's ambassador to Austria) was a walk-on at William and Mary but wound up starting 42 straight games for the Tribe. He redshirted in 2012 to get his game ready, then started seven of eight games played at left tackle in 2013. Ugokwe moved to the right tackle spot for the 2014 season and stayed on the right side as a junior, earning third-team All-Colonial Athletic Association notice for his efforts.

Vallejo led the team with 100 tackles as a sophomore, including 16.5 for loss, three sacks, one interception and four pass breakups, garnering second-team All-Mountain West accolades and winning MVP awards for the MWC championship game (13 tackles, three TFL, pick-six) and Fiesta Bowl (14 tackles, 1.5 sacks). He was an honorable mention all-conference selection in 2015 (57 tackles, eight TFL, two forced fumbles, two blocked kicks), though he missed two games due to injury and was suspended for the team's bowl game for violating team rules. Vallejo struggled with injuries during his senior year, playing with braces on both arms at times before shutting it down after nine games in order to have surgery on his right wrist in November.

He was the most prolific quarterback in Tennessee his final two years of high school (runner-up for one of the state's Mr. Football awards). As a redshirt freshman, Beathard played a little (9-27, TD, two INT) and the following year he saw the field more often (nine games, one start, 645 yards, five TD, two INT). He was given the reins of the offense as a junior, earning team MVP and second-team All-Big Ten honors by completing 61.6 percent of his passes for 2,809 pass yards, 17 touchdowns and just five interceptions.

Ben Boulware,"Boulware was the heart and soul of Clemson's national championship defense. His first love was motocross, though; he was home-schooled until the third grade so he could compete, but a broken arm suffered during a race ended that career. He was also a very good baseball player in high school (like his brother, Garrett, who was a 2014 draft pick of the Cincinnati Reds) -- but football turned out to be his best sport. The top 100 national recruit played in 11 games as a reserve and special teams demon in 2013 (25 tackles, 1.5 for loss).

Brown led the Bruins in stops again as a senior with 105 (seven for loss), garnering first-team All-Pac-12 recognition by also intercepting three passes and breaking up six others. The third of his siblings to play college football (Jason was a linebacker at Idaho, Juwuan a DL at Southern Oregon), Brown had to be patient for his chance to play on defense.

Riley became the fourth member of the family to play in East Lansing, with all four topping 200 career tackles (uncle Chuck had 391; father Shane, had 311; brother Max had 299; Riley with 214). His grandfather Hank was also an MSU offensive lineman and went on to play for the Green Bay Packers and coach for years in the NFL. Bullough redshirted his first year on campus, becoming one of the top players on the scout team. He moved from linebacker to fullback the following spring, playing as a reserve (22-83 rushing; 3-11 receiving) and on special teams as a sophomore until moving back to defense before the bowl game. Back at linebacker full-time in 2014, Bullough started one of 13 games played (29 tackles, four TFL, 3.5 sacks). His play against Baylor on the final series of the Cotton Bowl secured a victory, as he assisted on a sack and intercepted a pass with two seconds remaining. That play portended a second-team All-Big Ten junior year where he led the Spartans with 106 tackles (7.5 for loss, four sacks). Bullough showed up again in the team's semifinal loss to Alabama, making 11 tackles. Voted a team captain in 2016, Bullough was also a third-team all-conference pick (76 tackles, 6.5 TFL) despite missing three games with a shoulder injury. He won the team's ""Most Inspirational Player"" award in each of his final two seasons, as well.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/riley-bullough/32004255-4c62-3556-6492-bc2b89d7e050
Chunky Clements,"Jarrod Clements has been known as ""Chunky"" since birth, though at 6-foot-2, 290 pounds he's by no means a large defensive tackle at the college level. He is active, though, making 11.5 tackles for loss (out of 35 total) in 2015 and seven (36) in 2016. Clements played sparingly as a freshman (four tackles, one for loss) before earning three starting assignments as an injury replacement in 2014 (24 tackles, six for loss, two sacks).",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chunky-clements/3200434c-4528-1420-f966-5adef6afada8
Keionta Davis,"Davis could have left his hometown of Chattanooga to play major college football because of late FBS offers. He stayed with UTC, however, because they stuck with him after he suffered a knee injury his senior year of high school. Davis redshirted in 2012, contributed in 2013 (21 tackles, four for loss) and then became a second-team All-Southern Conference pick in 2014 (10.5 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, four forced fumbles). Scouts began to notice him in earnest as a junior, when he was a first-team All-SoCon pick and finished tied for second in the FCS with 13.5 sacks (17 total TFL). Davis had his second straight FCS All-American season in 2016, being credited with 10.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. NFL teams also saw him well quite well against Alabama early in the year (four tackles, 0.5 sack).",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keionta-davis/32004441-5650-0124-9397-1485303e6a01
Justin Davis,"It was supposed to be Davis' big year in 2016, and it started out that way until a high ankle sprain in the midst of what would have been his third straight 100-yard game caused him to miss three games. His statistics turned out to be ordinary because of the injury (564 rushing yards, two TD) and the rising star of Ronald Jones II. Davis graduated from high school a semester early so he could contribute as a true freshman (361 rushing yards, 6 TD) before an ankle injury ended his season. He contributed as a reserve in 2014 (595 yards, four TD rushing; 13-92, 2 TD receiving) and then became an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick as a junior by starting the final eight games (902 yards, seven TD rushing; 18-189 receiving).",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-davis/32004441-5649-9568-7f66-7ec80c443931
Hunter Dimick,"Dimick led the state of Utah in sacks as a high school junior and senior, so it's no surprise he's managed to chase quarterbacks in the Pac-12, as well. He started four games as a redshirt freshman and was credited with two sacks among his 30 tackles. Dimick stood up in 2014, earning honorable mention notice with 52 tackles, 14.5 for loss and ten sacks even though he missed two games due to injury. He injured his shoulder in 2015, missing six games (14 tackles, seven TFL, three sacks in seven games) but bounced back with a huge senior year. Dimick finished third in the country with 14.5 sacks, and among the national leaders with 20 tackles for loss. He was a first-team All-Pac-12 selection for his efforts.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hunter-dimick/32004449-4d20-0894-1081-2e83eb2df7cf
Ken Ekanem,"On paper, Ekanem will be lacking in both the physical and athletic traits that teams will want out of either a defensive end or outside linebacker. However, he has functional power, above average hands and a toughness to his game that could translate in the right scheme and for the right coach.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ken-ekanem/3200454b-4144-4955-1a7e-7a941d447034
Krishawn Hogan,"Hogan was barely a blip on the recruiting radar coming out of Warren High School in Ohio, but he had more catches and yards in his freshman season at Walsh University (32,393) than he did as a high school senior (20-216). Hogan then transferred to Marian, where he exploded on the NAIA scene with 82 receptions for 1,136 yards and 11 touchdowns. He earned the first of three first-team Mideast League honors that year, repeating the feat in 2015 (101-1,824, 16 TD receiving; 39-130, 15 TD rushing). The American Football Coaches Association named him a first-team All-American in his senior year (80-1,435 yards, 15 TD receiving; 23-43, 10 TD rushing; pass TD); he was also his conference's Offensive Player of the Year.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/krishawn-hogan/3200484f-4702-3409-5a3b-2813760347f3
Colin Holba,"Holba was the valedictorian of the largest high school in Kentucky, a three-year baseball player, and had two years of experience as a long snapper when he decided to walk on at Louisville. His father, John, played quarterback at Ohio University and Western Michigan, and his cousin, Andrew, is an offensive lineman at the Air Force Academy. Holba redshirted in 2012, and played in only one game between the 2013 and 2014 seasons as four-year starter Grant Donovan had everything under control. He stepped in for Donovan in 2015 as the team's short and long-snapper, and held that job in 2016 as well. He made three tackles in coverage the past two years while providing consistent snaps for placements and punts.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/colin-holba/3200484f-4c00-0580-dd6b-0fde7bfc8973
Jeremiah Ledbetter,"Ledbetter's father, Weldon, was a running back at Oklahoma from 1979 to 1982 and was drafted by Tampa Bay in the seventh round of the 1983 draft. He redshirted one season and played two more at Hutchinson Community College, finishing his career there as a second-team junior college All-American in 2014 with 24.5 tackles for loss and 15.5 sacks. Ledbetter stepped into the lineup right away for the Razorbacks, making 55 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and two sacks. He topped the squad with 5.5 sacks in his senior season, and was credited with 49 total tackles, 7.5 for loss.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremiah-ledbetter/32004c45-4422-9262-e724-6d0b876f579a
Robert Leff,"Despite ranking as a three-star high school prospect, Leff struggled to get on the field at Auburn until his senior season. He redshirted in 2012 and played primarily on special teams in 2013 and 2014. He finally got two starts as a junior (one as blocking tight end, the other at left tackle against Idaho) while playing in every game that season. Leff came on strong in his final year on the Plains, starting all 13 games at a new position (right tackle) and landing a spot on the second-team all-conference team (voted on by SEC media) for his efforts.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-leff/32004c45-4633-8460-992d-d799cd3027bc
Conor McDermott,"McDermott was an excellent basketball player in high school, but decided his future was instead in the football realm. He dislocated his shoulder in a state title basketball game, however, forcing him to go to a prep school for a year before heading to UCLA. McDermott redshirted his first year in Westwood, joining his brother, Kevin, who is now a long snapper with the Minnesota Vikings. After another year on the bench to add pounds to his basketball frame, McDermott started the final seven games of the 2014 season at left tackle. His game had improved enough in his junior year that Pac-12 coaches voted him second-team all-conference. He repeated that achievement in 2016, starting every game on the left side.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/conor-mcdermott/32004d43-4417-5819-67ec-d51a354455e1
Lewis Neal,"Plays with strength at the point of attack but is currently lacking the necessary traits to be a clean fit at end or tackle.

Greg Pyke,"Played both guard and tackle at Georgia but is a guard-only prospect.

James Quick,"Quick's father, Rhoniya, played football at Louisville, but James had made his own name as a high school football star. The Associated Press Mr. Football award winner for Kentucky in 2012 caught a touchdown pass in four straight state title games. As a track athlete, he also set a state record in the 200 meters. After learning the ropes as a true freshman in 2013 (6-73 receiving), he became a starter the following year (36-566, three TDs) and contributed as a returner (8-156 kicks; 20-148 punts) even though he was suspended for one game for violating team rules. Quick led the Cardinals in receiving as a junior (39-624, five TDs) and was tops on the squad in receiving yardage in 2016 (45-769, six TDs) on his way to third-team All-ACC honors.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-quick/32005155-4909-9494-6485-28d01a799f6b
Cooper Rush,"An actuarial science major with a 3.9 grade point average, Rush should not have any issues learning a new playbook in the NFL. He's started every game for the Chippewas since Week 2 of his freshman year. He nearly set all-time Mid-American Conference records for passing, coming up just 12 yards short of former CMU passer Dan LeFevour. In fact, Rush's production dropped a bit in his senior year, though he still was a third-team all-conference choice with 3,540 passing yards, 23 touchdowns, but with 16 interceptions and a mediocre 59.8 completion percentage. He had been on the rise the previous three seasons, first as the team Offensive Player of the Year as a redshirt freshman (2,349 yards, 15 TD, 15 INT, 56.7 completion pct) and a sophomore year (3,157 yards, 27 TD, 13 INT, 63.6 completion pct.) which he finished off by throwing for seven touchdowns against Western Kentucky in the Bahama Bowl. His best season came in 2015, where he was a second-team All-MAC pick by completing 66.3 percent of his passes for 3,848 yards, 25 touchdowns, and just 11 interceptions.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cooper-rush/32005255-5304-6607-6ca0-6d97a0d0f253
Sojourn Shelton,"Despite being a four-star recruit and all-county pick in the Miami area, Shelton decided to take his game to Wisconsin. He was a four-year starter for the Badgers, beginning with an honorable mention All-Big Ten freshman season (36 tackles, four interceptions, seven pass breakups), where his four picks ranked third in the nation among freshman. Shelton played in all 14 games, starting 12, in 2014, making 33 tackles and breaking up six passes. He earned honorable mention all-conference notice again in his junior year (29 tackles, seven pass breakups) and second-team All-Big Ten in 2016 (27 tackles, four interceptions, 12 pass breakups).",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sojourn-shelton/32005348-4544-3431-481e-442272d0c7d9
Jordan Sterns,"Sterns could have stayed in the Lone Star State for college as a four-star recruit, but chose to go to Stillwater instead. The Cowboys got an excellent player out of the deal, one who would lead the team in tackles three times, accumulating more than 100 stops (60 or more solo) each season. He played regularly as a reserve as a true freshman (13 tackles), then became a team leader in his sophomore year (103 tackles, 4.5 for loss, four pass break-ups, two blocked kicks). Sterns had 72 solo stops for the second straight year in 2015, receiving second-team All-Big 12 notice for his all-around play (108 total tackles, two interceptions). Once again he hit the century mark in tackles in a first-team All-Big 12 senior season, making 101 stops, 5.5 for loss, and set career highs with three interceptions and five pass break-ups.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-sterns/32005354-4557-0999-ee3a-a25f79241185
Freddie Stevenson,"Stevenson was a four-star recruit as a linebacker coming out of high school, but enrolled early and switched to a back-up fullback and special teams ace for the 2013 season (8-33, TD rushing; 2-18 receiving). He began leading the way for star running back Dalvin Cook in earnest in 2014, starting seven times and catching seven passes for 72 yards and a touchdown. Stevenson got 10 starts as a junior, (3-9 rushing; 9-64 receiving) and four starts in 2016, being used more often as a rusher (13-90, four TD).",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/freddie-stevenson/32005354-4567-3636-50e9-7b153995173c
Jahad Thomas,"Thomas wears the number five jersey as a tribute to USC Heisman Trophy winner (forfeited or not) and current NFL running back Reggie Bush. He's been an all-around contributor for the Owls over the past four years, starting as a kick returner in his true freshman season (24-476). Thomas cleared 1,000 all-purpose yards as a sophomore, carrying the ball 80 times for 384 yards (with four starts at running back) and contributing as a receiver (14-364, one TD) and returner (14-332 on kicks). Finally taking on the full rushing load in 2015, he garnered first-team All-American Athletic Conference notice (276-1,262, 17 TDs rushing; 22-216, one TD receiving; 6-199, TD on kick returns). Thomas was a second-team All-AAC pick in 2016, even though he missed the first two games of the year with a sprain in his left hand (207-953, 13 TDs rushing; 33-418, six TDs receiving; 2-28 kick returns; 8-101 punt returns).",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jahad-thomas/32005448-4f21-0047-249a-b832a3e9f3e5
Jack Tocho,"Tocho is the son of Kenyan immigrants, and has travelled to Africa several times. That worldly experience shows up in his maturity level, as he was a team captain and full-time starter as a senior (37 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions, nine pass breakups). He struggled with injuries in his junior year, missing part of three games and being limited in others while only starting three games on the year (20 tackles, one INT, three PBU). Big things had been expected of Tocho that year, as he was the team's Defensive Back of the Year in 2014 after leading the squad with 11 pass breakups (41 tackles, one INT). He was also the Wolfpack's Co-Freshman of the Year in 2012, starting seven times, making 25 tackles, intercepting two passes, and breaking up three others.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jack-tocho/3200544f-4326-6972-4a69-ac89a3125763
Alek Torgersen,"California talent and Ivy League intelligence is a good combination for an NFL prospect, and he's become one of the most decorated players in Penn history. Even in his first action as a Quaker, he received Ivy League Rookie of the Week in the season finale against Cornell, his only game of the season (6-10, 109 yards, two scores). The team struggled in 2014, but Torgersen successfully ran the offense, completing 26 passes per game for 2,689 yards, and 14 touchdowns (11 interceptions). He finished his career with back-to-back first-team All-Ivy League seasons, helping Penn win 14 games against five losses. In 2015, he had the second-highest completion percentage in FCS (69 percent, 1,996 yards, 19 TD, three INT). Torgersen then set school records in passing touchdowns and total offense during his senior year, completing 66.9 percent of his passes for 2,231 yards and 17 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.

Mike Tyson,"Tyson had to live with the boxing jokes that get thrown his way once people hear his name, as they'd reference the infamous doings of the former heavyweight champion. His grandfather, father, and even his young son also share the name, so he's learned to live with it. Tyson didn't take long to get on the field, earning enough playing time to rack up 18 tackles and intercept two passes as a freshman. He started three of 13 games played in 2014, making 41 stops and defending one pass on the year, and played in 11 games as a junior (four starts, 32 tackles, two for loss, four pass breakups).

Bobo Wilson,"Wilson is a slot receiver with the speed to attack the seam or work over the middle on the first and second levels. While his acceleration can create some separation for himself, his routes are too telegraphed and rounded to consistently shake defenders. His experience as both a punt and kick returner could give him the upper hand in a battle for a roster spot.",5.5,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bobo-wilson/32005749-4c72-6570-bbde-c7a95040b1e5
Brian Allen,"Allen did not play defense in high school, but Utah seems to be able to convert the long, tall receivers into coveted cornerback prospects. The married father of one played in 10 games as a reserve as a redshirt freshman in 2013, even playing receiver in one game. Allen contributed on special teams, safety and cornerback in six games the next season, missing the second half of the year with an injury. He returned to begin realizing his potential on the outside in 2015, playing in 13 games, starting three, intercepting a pass and breaking up three others.

Toby Baker,"Despite being a star quarterback and punter in high school, Baker had to walk on at Arkansas in 2012. He redshirted that year, and played sparingly in 2013 and 2014 before finally getting his shot as a junior. In 2015, he averaged 41.2 yards a punt, forced 16 fair catches versus just two touchbacks, and place 23-of-43 punts inside the 20-yard line. Baker missed out on all-conference honors his senior year, but he finished in the top 15 nationally in punting average (44.4), with 24 fair catches and 22 inside the 20 on 57 punts (just three ending up in touchbacks).",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/toby-baker/32004241-4b69-8563-7e13-947c9de4c4d7
Collin Bevins,"Hard-nosed, effort-based defensive end who stacked heavy sack production against a lower level of competition. Background as a wrestler gives him a greater understanding of leverage and allows him to punch above his weight at the point of attack.

DeAngelo Brown,"Louisville's defense had a lot of talent on the edge in 2016, but the team's leader in tackles for loss (14) was Brown, the team's nose tackle and one of the strongest players in college football (40 reps of 225 pounds). He was a third-team All-ACC pick on the season (41 tackles, three sacks). The Georgia native caught scouts' eyes as a junior, as he started all 13 games and racked up 40 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and 1.5 sacks. Brown's early career had some setbacks, however. He played in seven games as a freshman (10 tackles, one TFL) but missed the 2013 season after suffering a torn Achilles in summer workouts.

Brown took over the starting Mike job in 2015 (after marrying former MSU softball player Erin Nesbit), leading the team with 109 tackles (13 for loss) and 6.5 sacks.

Billy Brown,"Academic issues prevented Brown from going to a FBS school after high school (he had interest from West Virginia and Maryland), so he chose to attend Division II Shepherd University instead of a junior college. His 6-foot-4, 240-pound frame made him a major matchup problem at that level. As a freshman, Brown started three games (25-323, five TDs) and received honorable mention all-conference honors. After a redshirt season, he started nine of 10 contests in 2014 (30-676, six TDs), earning second-team All-Mountain East Conference honors. Brown's game took off the past two seasons. He garnered first-team all-conference and third-team AP Little All-American honors in 2015 with 89 catches for 1,492 yards and 10 scores.

Before the injury in his junior year, Brown was a first-team all-conference pick with 25 catches for 420 yards and six scores. The football and basketball star from Ohio played in 12 games as a freshman in 2012, catching two passes for 42 yards.

He was a walk-on with the Aztecs, coming out of high school as a second-team all-state pick at center, and didn't earn a scholarship until before his junior year. After winning the team's Co-Offensive Scout Player of the Year in 2012, Brunskill played in all 13 games as a blocking tight end the following season. He had his first receptions the following year (5-31, TD), starting four times.

At that point in his football career, he was searching for a position. He redshirted as a preferred walk-on in 2012 and then didn't see the field the following season as he moved from running back to wide receiver. Carr got on the field a bit in 2014 (7-100) and then contributed enough as a junior (16-302, two TD) to receive a scholarship. His play took off as a senior, receiving first-team All-Big 12 honors in addition to the aforementioned receiver award as he snatched 90 throws for 1,247 yards and 12 scores.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-carr/32004341-5234-3555-1b9e-f8328ba90eca
Cethan Carter,"A highly-recruited multi-purpose offensive player out of Louisiana, Carter eschewed advances from schools like LSU and Miami to go to the Midwest. He got on the field right away, playing in every game and starting six, catching 10 passes for 127 yards. His sophomore season was derailed by a mid-season foot injury, though he started eight games and caught six passes for 98 yards and one score.

Lucas Crowley,"Crowley was one of the top five high school center recruits in the country in 2012, and played for a coach in Ponte Vedra who knows about high-level offensive play in former Florida quarterback Shane Matthews. Crowley actually started one game as a true freshman against Pittsburgh, taking on an All-American and future NFL All-Pro in Aaron Donald. He's been in the middle for the Tar Heels as the leader of the offensive line ever since, only missing one game with a sprained ankle in 2014. Crowley was a third-team All-ACC pick in 2015 and a second-team selection as a senior.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lucas-crowley/32004352-4f78-0440-1b85-c02a5130b16a
Kevin Davis,"A Parade High School All-American as a senior, Davis signed up to play in his home state. The past two seasons, he's been one of the best linebackers west of the Mississippi. The 2016 second-team All-Mountain West pick led the Rams with 110 tackles, 10.5 for loss, three sacks and four forced fumbles (tied for 10th nationally). Great things were expected from Davis this year because of his first year as a starter in 2015, where he earned honorable mention all-conference recognition as CSU's top tackle (101, 14 for loss). It took Davis a couple of years to reach his potential, however, due to injuries. He was injured on the opening kickoff against Hawaii his freshman year, keeping him as a reserve in eight games (23 tackles). Davis was granted a medical redshirt the next season after four games (one tackle) on special teams. He missed two more games with an ailment in 2014, but wound up starting one game and making 22 tackles (2.5 for loss, sack) in 11 games that season.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-davis/32004441-5651-3779-59f5-09cba4436256
Brooks Ellis,"The Razorbacks kept one of their best talents in-state when they signed Ellis, a two-time state Defensive Player of the Year and state champion. He impressed the coaches enough to get into the starting line-up for the final four games as a true freshman (33 tackles, two for loss) and racked up 10 tackles against LSU in the season finale. He made plays regularly as a sophomore starter (72 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two interceptions, five pass break-ups), and then led the Razorbacks with 102 tackles in 2015 (eight for loss, 1.5 sacks, three PBU).

Darius English,"English saw a spike in his sack production this year and he does have enough athleticism to get around the corner as a rusher if his hands are right.

He did graduate, as Miami allowed him to stay on scholarship in the fall, then decided to leave for the NFL instead of attempting to be reinstated. Grace started his career as a special teams player in 2013 (eight tackles) and then was an oft-used back-up linebacker as a sophomore (60 tackles, 6.5 for loss, three sacks).

Hamilton picked up his first of three straight first-team All-SoCon honors in 2014 (55-877, six TD), and had similar production in his junior year (75-880, four TD receiving; 5-179, TD on kickoff returns). His game exploded in 2016, however, as he garnered first-team Associated Press All-American notice by ranking second in the FCS with 111 receptions and 126.3 receiving yards per game (1,389 total).

Bug Howard,"Howard has the height and weight part, but is missing the speed and that could make finding a draft-day home a challenge. Howard is a possession receiver who can work in traffic and catch what is thrown to him, but he is unable to create enough separation with his routes. Howard's lack of special teams experience is another obstacle he may have to overcome to make a roster.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bug-howard/3200484f-5722-9668-8276-3db73c8d6912

Hunt improved as a sophomore, earning honorable mention All-Mountain West honors (43.8 gross avg, 14 inside 20 vs four TB). A Ray Guy award finalist in 2015, Hunt ranked fifth in FBS in gross punting average (46.0 yards) and led the nation in net average (41.96) most of the year. The second-team All-Mountain West pick had 18 fair catches forced, 24 dropped inside the 20, and just a single touchback, all among the best figures in the country. Hunt was a first-team all-conference selection as a senior (44.3 gross avg., 40.9 net avg., 22 inside of 20, two TB) and also held for placements.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hayden-hunt/32004855-4e24-4784-7946-603727fb82fe

The younger Kalis would like to have a long pro career, as well, but also wishes to be a WWE wrestler at some point in the future. The Parade All-American originally committed to Ohio State but switched to Michigan when NCAA sanctions hit the Buckeyes program. In his redshirt freshman and sophomore seasons, Kalis started at right guard on a part-time basis (nine in 2013 and seven in 2014, playing in 24 games).

He considered going to Iowa, but eventually signed with Auburn as a four-star recruit. SEC coaches named him to the conference All-Freshman squad one season after he redshirted, as he started all 14 games at the left guard spot. Kozan missed the 2014 season due to a back injury, but returned to lineup on the left side of the line for all 13 games the following season.

Jerome Lane,"Lane wasn't a well-known football recruit coming out of high school, partially because he was expected to follow in his father's footsteps on the basketball court. Jerome Lane, Sr. was a big-bodied star forward at the University of Pittsburgh in the late 1980s, but told his son to play football. Since moving to receiver after the 2014 season, however, Lane has shown the physicality and hands that are indicative of a basketball player. He redshirted in 2013 and played 12 games at safety and linebacker on defense the following year (14 tackles, five sacks, safety). Lane played all 13 games (starting 11) at receiver as a sophomore, catching 39 passes for a team-leading 782 yards and eight scores despite having surgery on a torn ligament before the season.

Shalom Luani,"Luani has the ball production and enough flashes on tape that scouts will be forced to keep him alive in their draft meetings. While Luani showed some improvement as a tackler, Washington State was forced to protect him by playing him in more underneath zone where he was able to cover and not worry about being the last line of defense. Luani likely needs to get his start as a special teams cover man, but without fundamental tackling, that could be a challenge.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shalom-luani/32004c55-4144-4954-cf6a-ca2410c3b470

Lucas had a breakout year as a sophomore, receiving second-team All-American Athletic Conference honors by finishing near the top of the FBS rankings with 101 receptions and 1,219 receiving yards, while leading the AAC with 11 touchdowns. He started the next season strong, starting four games (26-409, five TD) before tearing a patella tendon against Houston.

He tried to get the win in a bowl game the year before (297 yards, 3 TD vs Air Force in the Potato Bowl), but had to settle for second-team All-MAC honors and leading the conference in completion percentage (67.9, 3.443 yards, 26 TD, 10 INT).

Sam Tevi,"Tevi (pronounced Tevv-ee) suited up as a defensive lineman as a true freshman for the Utes in 2013, playing in 11 games and contributing nine tackles, two for loss, and a sack. Coaches wanted him to move to the offensive line, which Tevi wasn't keen on right away. But he made the switch for the sake of the team, and it's paid off for him personally, as he's now an NFL prospect. He played special teams and occasionally on the line during the 2014 season before earning the starting job on the blind side for all 13 games of his junior campaign. The team needed him to move to the right tackle spot due to injuries on the line, and he flourished there, as well, other than missing two games with a back injury.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sam-tevi/32005445-5627-1136-7757-d813b18d1bd2
Nate Theaker,"Theaker was an All-State pick in Michigan, but couldn't get more than passing glances from MAC schools. He took the scholarship offer from WSU, and hasn't looked back. He redshirted in 2011, then played in 10 games (starting one) at right tackle the following season. Theaker played in all 11 games as a sophomore, starting two at right tackle, before sliding over to the starting spot at right guard in nine of 10 games in 2013 (with one start at RT). He was a first-team All-Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference selection as a junior, starting five games at right guard and then moving to right tackle because of injuries along the line. Theaker missed the 2015 season after having back surgery, but bounced back as the team's new starting left tackle last fall. He was named to the Associated Press' Little All-American squad after the season, while also receiving first-team all-conference and GLIAC Offensive Lineman of the Year awards.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-theaker/32005448-4505-2671-d3f0-3ce0f3b62ce3
Ahmad Thomas,"Thomas has the experience and success as a special teams player that will give him an advantage when trying to secure a roster spot, but he can't hang his hat on being a box safety or a cover specialist and his lack of deep speed is a concern.

Bret Treadway,"Has Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) talent and plays with a level of consistency and tenacity that offensive line coaches dream about. Unfortunately, a lack of NFL mass could be a non-starter for many NFL teams, and if there are also medical concerns to go with it, he could very well go undrafted. However, if his medicals are right and he is able to pack some mass on, he has an opportunity to be taken on the third day (Rounds 4-7) and become an eventual starting center.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bret-treadway/32005452-4540-3290-107a-65d3f760dc4e
Justin Vogel,"Paul Vogel was a middle linebacker at South Carolina, and was on rosters for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Houston Oilers in the NFL. His son, Justin, decided to use his foot to follow in his dad's footsteps in a successful college and potential pro career. Vogel signed with Florida coming out of Berkeley Prep in Tampa, but did not see the field in his redshirt or freshman years with the Gators. He decided to walk on at Miami for the 2014 season so that he could participate right away, and won the job (42.8 yards per punt, 20-of-52 punts fair-caught, 21 punts inside the 20-yard line, only one touchback). Vogel was the team's top leg in 2015 (42.5 avg, 20-of-67 fair-caught, 21 inside 20, six touchbacks) but saved his best effort for a second-team All-ACC senior season (43.8 avg, 33-of-64 fair-caught, 25 inside 20, two touchbacks, one blocked).",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-vogel/3200564f-4726-4860-4742-d1cd3378acb1
Greg Ward,Dual-threat quarterback who consistently found ways to make plays and win. Came into college as a wide receiver and won't have to step blindly into new position. Good speed and has the fluid hips to shake defenders in space after the catch. Coaches praise him for his toughness and football intelligence. Background as quarterback allows him to identify coverages quickly as a wideout.

Jordan Westerkamp,"Nebraska pulled Westerkamp out of Illinois despite his being a first-team USA Today All-American and all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. His team won three straight state titles, one of which he carried the team with 12 catches for 353 yards and five scores. In his redshirt freshman season, he played in all 13 games, starting one (20-283, one TD). Westerkamp led the team in receiving the following three seasons. He won the 2014 ESPN College Football Play of the Year with a fantastic behind-the-back grab and caught 44 passes for 747 yards and five scores that season. Westerkamp started all 13 games as a junior, receiving second-team All-Big Ten honors by setting a school record for receptions with 65, for 918 yards and seven touchdowns. A back injury derailed his chances at setting major school receiving records; he started only two games while playing in ten, but was still the team's top receiver (38-526, five TDs).",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-westerkamp/32005745-5365-1763-7cf8-1ac2e7a4c331
Kermit Whitfield,"Speed is not an issue for Whitfield. He was a Florida state champion in the 100 and 200 meters as a senior, and won the Adidas Dream 100 race against the nation's top high school sprinters. Whitfield translated that speed to become one of the top kick returners in the country; he accumulated 2,386 yards in that capacity, including two touchdowns his freshman season (one in the BCS Championship Game), when he led the FBS and broke the ACC record for yards per return (36.4). His contributions as a receiver were limited in his first two seasons, however, as he failed to score in that manner (5-89 in 2013, 11-145 in 2014). Whitfield garnered second-team All-ACC notice as a receiver (and third-team as a returner) as a junior, though, catching 57 passes for 798 yards and six scores. His production dropped as a senior (34-395, one TD), as he only started seven games with the emergence of Nyqwan Murray and others.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kermit-whitfield/32005748-4965-6258-1b12-de79f5b01f22
Stanley Williams,"Williams could have gone to several SEC schools as a four-star recruit but chose Kentucky to make a name for himself. With a nickname like ""Boom,"" that's not too difficult, even on a team that has limited success. Williams led the Wildcats in rushing each of his three seasons on campus, starting with a true freshman season in which he only started one game (486 yards, one TD rushing; 17-162, one TD receiving). In 2015, he set a school record with 7.1 yards per carry, converting 121 chances to 855 yards and six scores. He had a rough offseason before his final season in Lexington, losing his younger sister and going through elbow surgery. Nonetheless, Boom had his best season in 2016, running for 1,170 yards on just 171 carries and scoring seven times.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stanley-williams/32005749-4c52-5037-b7c3-6fa30fbaa6f8
DeAngelo Yancey,"Purdue has won a total of nine games in the four years Yancey has been on campus, so he's flown a bit under the radar. The Atlanta native has been a strong part of any success the team has had since 2013, however. As a true freshman, he started five games, catching 32 passes for 546 yards and two touchdowns. He was a part-time starter again in 2014 (seven starts, 12-147, three TDs) before hitting his stride as a junior. Yancey led the Boilermakers with 700 yards on 48 receptions, scoring five times in the process. For the second year in the row, he paced the squad with 951 yards on 49 catches and 10 touchdowns, earning third-team All-Big Ten accolades in the process.",5.4,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deangelo-yancey/32005941-4e26-5892-f597-4aebdd0b8988
Kareem Are,"Are grew up a New York kid, and went the junior college route before coming to Tallahassee. He was the top junior college guard in the country coming out of Fort Scott Community College, where he was all-region and all-conference both seasons. Are redshirted in his first year with FSU as the team's depth allowed him that opportunity. He played in every game in 2015, starting eight at the left guard spot. Injuries cost him time in 2016, however, as he missed the three games with concussion symptoms. He managed to start nine games, though, at left guard, receiving second-team All-ACC honors from both league coaches and media.",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kareem-are/32004152-4501-3842-c9d4-1064624fd9b4
Josh Augusta,"Though Augusta hasn't been a starter for most of his career, he's contributed greatly in every game over the past four seasons for the Tigers. He stepped up his playing time between his freshman (nine tackles, three for loss, two sacks) and sophomore (23 tackles, 4.5 for loss, sack, two forced fumbles) seasons. The only season in which Augusta started games was 2015, and he lined up first in all 12 games (27 tackles, 8.5 for loss). He finished his career as a key reserve (23 tackles, four for loss, sack), and was used as a fullback in short-yardage situations.",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-augusta/32004155-4744-0726-9c64-f1aff7e68d59
Ben Braden,"Braden grew up wanting to play goalie for the Detroit Red Wings like long-time puck-stopper Dominik Hasek. But he grew into an NFL-sized body by the time he left high school, so his game plan changed. The Michigan all-state selection and Detroit New Blue Chip honoree stayed in-state with the Wolverines, redshirting his first year and playing in two games as a reserve in 2013. Braden earned a starting job at right tackle as a sophomore and then earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice at guard in 2015. He was a second-team All-Big Ten pick as a senior, splitting time between left guard (four games) and left tackle (seven), even starting on the blind side against Florida State in the Orange Bowl.",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-braden/32004252-4109-3113-e08f-3b4f1fb4c1ba
Gehrig Dieter,"Dieter is, in fact, named after New York Yankees great Lou Gehrig. Two of his brothers, Thurman (Munson) and Nolan (Ryan), were also named after baseball players. His future is in football, however, as he showed during his productive college career. That career had three stops; first, he suited up at SMU for the 2012 season (three starts, 10-168, one TD). After his receiver coach left the Mustangs, Dieter transferred closer to his South Bend home to Bowling Green, redshirting the fall of 2013. He started six games as a sophomore (35-460, one TD) for the Falcons before hitting the big time. Dieter was a second-team All-MAC pick and ranked ninth in the FBS with 94 receptions for 1,033 yards and 10 TD. Dieter had a chance to transfer as a graduate student for his final year of eligibility, and Alabama came calling.

Glass made himself known to Bulldogs fans in 2015, leading the team with four interceptions despite just eight starts (62 tackles, 1.5 TFL, six PBU).

Joey Ivie,"Football took a backseat in the life of Ivie in April 2015, when he rushed home to be with his younger sister, Jordan, after a car accident. He was holding her when her heart stopped. His younger brother, Andrew, was meant to play with Joey the past two years at Florida, but was forced to give up the sport for medical reasons. In spite of all of this, Ivie has been a strong contributor for the Gators. After playing three of the team's last five games as a true freshman (three tackles), he was a key reserve upfront in 2014 (one start, 24 tackles, three for loss, sack). Ivie was a part-time starter as a junior, starting five of ten games played, making 27 stops, four for loss and 3.5 sacks.

His mother, Wendy, was diagnosed with breast cancer, so he left the Academy to return closer to home at Kilgore Community College. He played one season there (14-137, one touchdown), before moving on to LSU as his mother went into remission. In 2014 he played in 11 games but did not catch a pass. In a starting role as a junior, he caught 12 passes for 132 yards and a score.

Dad's former coach played Junior quite a bit as a true freshman, recording 24 tackles on the season. Stepping into the starting lineup as a sophomore, Kelsey compiled 87 tackles in the middle, including seven for loss, and six sacks. League coaches voted him second-team All-ACC in 2015, as he lead the Cardinals with 107 tackles, 12 for loss, and 3.5 sacks.

For the year, Knight completed just 53.3 percent of his passes for 2,432 yards, 19 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. He was the team's second-leading rusher as well, with 614 yards and 10 scores on 102 carries. Knight transferred from Oklahoma as a graduate student after the 2015 season (22-40, 305 yards, two TDs in six games), as two-time Heisman Trophy finalist Baker Mayfield had a grip on the starting job there. In 2014, Knight not only started 10 games (56.6 completion pct, 2,300 yards, 14 TDs, 12 INTs; 339 yards, five TDs rushing) but was a Wuerffel Trophy finalist for his academic and athletic achievements. He sat out three games, however, after suffering transient quadriplegia (a stinger that affects both sides of the body) against Baylor.

But the former top 20 quarterback recruit has been very successful as a four-year starter with the Buffaloes. Liufau did not play in the first four games of his freshman year, but the team ripped off the redshirt so he could start seven of the last nine contests (1,779 yards, 12 TD, eight INT, 59.4 completion pct). He was a team captain, team MVP, and honorable mention All-Pac-12 as a sophomore, setting many school records after completing 65.3 percent of his 498 throws for 3,200 yards and 28 touchdowns with 15 interceptions. Statistically, his junior year was not as successful (2,418 yards, nine TD, six INT, 62.2 completion pct) and he missed the end of the season with a Lisfranc injury in his foot. Liufau started 11 games as a senior, battling an ankle injury that prevented him from playing two games.

He started his collegiate career at Oklahoma State, starting five times right off the bat (1,108 yards, six TD, seven INT) before inconsistent play, his left knee and a head injury cost him his starting job. He attempted to transfer from OSU, and met some restrictions by the coaches there before deciding to return to his home state. Lunt showed some promise in 2014, starting seven times and leading the team to three fourth-quarter wins (1,763 yards, 14 TD, three INT, 63.4 completion percentage). He started all 12 games in 2015 (1,763 yards, 14 TD, six INT, 56.1 completion pct) but couldn't stay healthy in 2016, missing four games with a back injury and playing inconsistently when on the field (1,376 yards, eight TD, three INT, 54.7 completion pct).",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/wes-lunt/32004c55-4e67-6329-6798-3f46bb95b100

He moved to running back for his second season with the Mountaineers in 2013 (2-9 rushing) before moving on to Arizona Western Junior College, where he was an All-American and conference defensive player of the year at safety (101 tackles, six for loss, two interceptions, three blocked kicks). Magloire started out at safety for the Wildcats, but moved to linebacker partway through the 2015 season, starting the final eight games there (72 tackles, four TFL).

He started six times as a true freshman, learning the ropes (1,776 yards, 13 TD, 14 INT, 49.3 completion pct) while the team went 1-5 in those games. Mullens started 10 games the following year, missing two with a foot injury, and his efficiency improved (2,470 yards, 12 TD, 9 INT, 59.7 completion pct) but the team failed to go to a bowl game. Finally, everything came together in 2015; he completed 63.5 percent of his 521 passes for 4,476 yards, 38 touchdowns and just 12 interceptions. He was the Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year and a second-team all-conference pick (behind league MVP Brandon Doughty from Western Kentucky). Though he missed two games with an injury this fall and was only an honorable mention selection by league coaches (3,272 yards, 24 TD, 11 INT, 63.3 completion pct), Mullens led his team to a bowl win in his final game. Mullens also showed great toughness by playing through an injury to the thumb on his throwing hand where a bone popped through his skin.

He started 10 games in 2013 (76 tackles, nine TFL, four sacks, three forced fumbles) but really came on as a junior. Taylor was a second-team All-AAC pick even though he led the conference in sacks that year with 10, as part of 92 stops in total, 18.5 for loss. He continued his playmaking ways in a first-team All-ACC 2016 season (74 tackles, 12 TFL, 8.5 sacks), though he was sat down for one game for violating team rules.",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/steve-taylor/32005441-5971-1900-ac54-7c36f50e56b3
Dymonte Thomas,"Thomas could be one of a dozen or more Wolverines drafted in April, thanks to a senior season where he finally got a chance to regularly start. A hard-nosed player and excellent athlete, Thomas was a special teams force for the Wolverines as a freshman (seven tackles). He stepped in to start three games as a sophomore (27 tackles, forced fumble) and then four games as a junior (24 tackles, seven pass breakups). Thomas received honorable mention notice by league media and coaches in 2016, as he was with the starters in 12 of 13 contests, making 70 tackles, intercepting one pass, and breaking up nine others.",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dymonte-thomas/32005448-4f12-5786-67c0-cb738f83c6e9
Cameron Tom,"This pivot man with a relatively slim build and two first names has been a staple on the Golden Eagles' line the past four seasons; quarterback Nick Mullens would be the first to tell you that his success is directly related to the play of his snapper and leader of the line. Tom has garnered first-team All-Conference USA recognition in each of the last two seasons, starting all 27 games in the middle. He lined up for all 12 games at center in 2014, receiving honorable mention notice, following a Conference USA All-Freshman season in which he started nine times at the right tackle spot.",5.1,2017,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-tom/3200544f-4d05-5715-ccde-68f561ea11be
Saquon Barkley,"Barkley has gained notoriety for not only his work on the field, but his relentless work ethic in the weight room and in practice makes his great-uncle, former boxing champion Iran Barkley, proud. Barkley was a four-star recruit and all-state pick (1,856 yards, 31 total TD as a senior) and 100-meter state champion from Pennsylvania (though born in the Bronx). In his first year with the Nittany Lions, all Barkley did was set a school record for freshmen with 1,076 yards (on 182 carries, with seven scores; 20 receptions, 161 yards, TD receiving) and earn Freshman All-American and second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started six of 11 games played, missing two with an ankle injury, with one of his best accomplishments being that he ran for 195 yards and two scores against Ohio State on the road. Barkley really excelled as a sophomore, garnering third-team Associated Press All-American accolades and being named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year after running for 1,496 yards and 18 touchdowns (tied for sixth in the FBS) on 272 carries (ninth). He finished off the year with 204 yards and two scores on 25 carries against USC in the Rose Bowl, showing off his elite speed and cutting ability, as well as receiving ability and willingness to participate in pass protection.",7.45,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/saquon-barkley/32004241-5219-2674-af43-1519254e563d
Bradley Chubb,"Football runs in the blood of the Chubb family. Bradley's father, Aaron, was a star linebacker at Georgia. His brother, Brandon, was a very good linebacker at Wake Forest. And yes, he is related (cousin) to Georgia's senior running back, Nick Chubb. Bradley is the most talented of them all, showing off his wares during a first-team All-American and first-team All-ACC senior season where he won the 2017 Hendricks (best defensive end) and Bronko Nagurski (best defender) Awards. He finished second in the FBS with 26 tackles for loss and lit up quarterbacks 10 times, breaking up two passes, in addition to forcing three fumbles. He had a second-team All-ACC (coaches) and team Defensive MVP junior season (22 tackles for loss ranked in the top four nationally, 9.5 sacks, three forced fumbles). Chubb used his NFL size, violent hands, and relentless pressure to rack up those TFL playing on either side of the line, with only former No. 1 overall pick Mario Williams collecting more in a season for State (Chubb wore Williams' No. 9 jersey in 2016 and 2017). He showed flashes as a sophomore, with 12 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles after contributing as a true freshman (four tackles in 11 games).",7.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bradley-chubb/32004348-5502-8799-5aa8-cdcf49ff8897
Quenton Nelson,"Defensive linemen facing Nelson and Mike McGlinchey on the left side of the Irish's line usually had a long day ahead of them. Nelson is a tough New Jersey kid who earned second-team USA Today All-American honors as a high school senior and was ranked in the top 50 overall recruits nationally as a guard. Notre Dame didn't need him to suit up as a freshman, however, so he redshirted. Nelson got his chance in 2015, starting 11 of 12 games played at left guard (missing parts of two games with an ankle injury) next to 2016 first-round pick Ronnie Stanley. He and McGlinchey then manned the left side in all 12 games of the Irish's disappointing 2016 season, though scouts weren't disappointed with Nelson's ability to move the line of scrimmage low and strong, as well as force defenders to the ground with regularity.",7.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quenton-nelson/32004e45-4c60-0785-9864-886959a28ac6
Tremaine Edmunds,"Edmunds is the son of Ferrell Edmunds, a two-time Pro Bowler at tight end with Miami (1989-90). Three of Ferrell's sons actually signed not with his alma mater of Maryland, but with the Hokies (though the oldest, Trey, transferred to play running back at Maryland for his final season in 2016). Tremaine and his brother, Terrell (safety), are now leaders on Tech's defense. One of the top linebacker recruits in the country, Tremaine played in 13 games as a true freshman, starting twice, recording 11 tackles on the year. His 2.5 tackles for loss came against Tulsa in the Independence Bowl, portending his successful sophomore year. Edmunds, who is tall and long for a stack linebacker, attacked open lanes to become a second-team All-ACC pick in 2016, starting 14 times and compiling 106 tackles, 18.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks. He had an interception in the team‚Äôs Belk Bowl appearance against Arkansas. NFL scouts loved what they saw from Edmunds as a junior, as did the Associated Press, who named him third-team All-American. He was also a first-team All-ACC selection in 2017, recording a team-high 109 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles.",7.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tremaine-edmunds/32004544-4d00-0000-c30c-56fb5191e34f
Sam Darnold,"Right now, Darnold is the second-most famous member of his family. His grandfather, Dick Hammer, was a USC basketball player, an Olympic volleyball player, and actor -- in fact, he was one of the Mr. Marlboro Men. Sam's father, Mike, also played football at Redlands College and several other relatives were collegiate athletes. Soon enough, however, Darnold will become the top dog in the family. The High School All-American and Orange County Offensive Player of the Year (67.8 completion percentage, 2,996 yards, 39 touchdowns, eight interceptions) also excelled at basketball and baseball, even though he missed time with a broken foot (suffered during football) and a broken finger. Darnold redshirted in 2015, sitting behind Cody Kessler and Max Browne. Browne ended up transferring to Pitt after 2016, as he saw the mature, pro-sized, strong-armed, and accurate Darnold take his job. He played in all 13 games, starting the final nine, completing 67.2 percent of 366 passes for 3,086 yards, 31 touchdowns and just nine interceptions. Darnold also has the athleticism to make plays with his feet (62 rush attempts, 250 yards, two rushing touchdowns).  He was voted first-team All-Pac-12 by league coaches in 2017, completing 63.1 percent of his passes (303-of-480) for 4,143 yards and 26 touchdowns on the for the conference champs.

Daron Payne,"Payne came to Alabama as a 350-pound behemoth who was a top 20 national high school recruit, but for his senior year played closer to 300 while still keeping his elite strength to move back the center and shed the block to make plays. With Jonathan Allen in the pros, Payne took over as the playmaker inside, earning second-team All-SEC honors (53 tackles, one sack, one interception, three pass break-ups). Payne saved his best for last, dominating inside against Georgia in the national championship game. He was a 15-game starter as a sophomore in 2016, making 36 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and 1.5 sacks from the nose guard position. Payne started three games in the middle as a true freshman in 2015, stopping the ball 13 times with half a tackle for loss.",7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daron-payne/32005041-5928-1222-6afa-41ec925627a4
Roquan Smith,"One of the top high school recruits in the country (top 30 overall, second-ranked linebacker), Smith stayed in his home state of Georgia to play football after being named the Class AA Defensive Player of the Year by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as a senior. He played as a reserve his true freshman season (20 tackles, four for loss) before becoming a defensive leader in 2016.

Vita Vea,"Vea's combination of size and light feet are rare. In fact, even at about 350 pounds he was lining up as an edge rusher at times in 2016 to take advantage of his genetics. While only starting five of 14 games played as a sophomore, Pac-12 coaches voted him second-team all-conference after he compiled 39 stops, 6.5 for loss, and five sacks. Vea played in all 13 games as a reserve in 2015, posting 17 tackles, three for loss, and a sack. His play late in the year portended a bright future, though, as he forced a fumble against Washington State in the Huskies' Apple Cup win and had a sack in their bowl game.  Vea did not qualify academically after finishing his high school career in Milpitas, California (eight sacks, 578 yards, 11 touchdowns rushing as a senior). He missed the 2013 season while staying home to take online courses to get himself eligible for the following fall when he redshirted with the Huskies.",7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vita-vea/32005645-4106-5410-5ca3-d47503c045e3

He redshirted in 2014 before taking a reserve role for 12 games in 2015 (10 tackles, 1.5 for loss). As a sophomore, Bryan started two of 13 games played, making 17 tackles, three for loss, and one sack, and showing glimpses of his potential. NFL scouts got to see even more possibilities during his junior season, as he started all 11 games (one September game was canceled due to weather), posting 40 tackles, six for loss, and four sacks.

Derwin James,"Already considered one of the most impactful defenders in college football after his freshman year because of his tall, chiseled frame, long arms for sure tackling, and relentless nature, much was expected of James heading into 2016. He delivered in the opener against Ole Miss (eight tackles, interception), but unfortunately, a left lateral meniscus tear suffered in the second week of the season put him on the sideline for the rest of the year. Expectations were already through the roof for James as an All-Florida pick from Haines City High (94 tackles, four INT in eight games), where he was the top DB recruit in the country. But then he racked up Freshman All-American and third-team All-ACC (league media) honors after an outstanding freshman season where he played in all 13 games, starting the final eight (91 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, five pass break-ups, two forced fumbles). James had 14 stops, two for loss, and a sack against Houston in the 2015 Peach Bowl. James' junior season went about as expected, as he earned second-team AP All-American and first-team All-ACC honors with 84 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two interceptions, 11 pass break-ups, and a blocked kick. He started 12 games on the year, skipping the Independence Bowl to focus on preparing for the NFL Draft.

Calvin Ridley,"The nation's top receiver recruit in 2014, Ridley left Florida to go to Alabama, just as Amari Cooper did not long before. Ridley could only play three games in his senior year due to age restrictions but caught 18 passes for 420 yards and four touchdowns in that time. He was a second-team All-SEC pick as a true freshman in 2015, setting a school record with 1,045 receiving yards (breaking Cooper's mark) on a team-high 89 receptions while starting 11 of 15 games played. He caught eight passes for 138 yards and two scores against Michigan State in the national semifinal as the eventual champion moved onto the title game. The Tide's passing game took a step back in his sophomore year, as did Ridley's statistics (72 receptions, 769 yards, seven touchdowns). Those numbers fluctuated again in 2017, though he produced enough in the run-oriented scheme to earn first-team All-SEC recognition (63 receptions, 967 yards, five touchdowns).

Leighton Vander Esch,"Vander Esch's family made headlines before the Las Vegas Bowl in December, and his play during the team's win over Oregon made the headlines afterward. The Vander Esch's cruised from Idaho to Las Vegas in a big bus adorned with Leighton's picture, number, and team colors. The 2017 Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year (and team captain) paid off their trip with 12 tackles, three for loss, a sack, and a forced fumble. He was also the Mountain West Championship Game MVP with 16 tackles and a game-sealing interception. The first-team all-conference pick totaled 141 tackles, 8.5 for loss, four sacks, four pass breakups, and four forced fumbles in his junior season. Vander Esch was limited to six games due to injuries in 2016 (27 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one sack, one interception), and was a reserve for 12 games the previous year as a redshirt freshman (20 tackles, sack).

Denzel Ward,"OSU cornerbacks coach Kerry Coombs told reporters last spring that Ward was a ""gifted player"" and truly a ""third starter"" at cornerback, joining 2017 first-round picks Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley. Ward proved his coach correct, earning first-team All-American and all-conference accolades in 2017 with 37 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions, and 15 pass breakups (ranked in the top 10 in the nation). He earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league media as a non-starter in 2016, playing 30 snaps a game on defense. Ward tied Lattimore for the team lead with nine pass breakups on the year (23 tackles), never giving up on a play and being quite physical despite his average size for the position. Ward got onto the field as a true freshman, making seven tackles, primarily on special teams. Ward was a first-team All-Ohio pick and Division II Co-Defensive Player of the Year as a high school senior (nine interceptions, 18 pass breakups).

Jaire Alexander,"While Alexander was just a three-star prospect coming out of North Carolina, and ranked only in the top 70 cornerbacks in the country, Louisville saw a future starter in his speed, ball skills, and physical play on the outside. He proved them correct in 2016, intercepting five passes and breaking up nine others in 13 starts to garner second-team All-ACC honors. Alexander played in 12 games, with one start on defense (19 tackles, one interception) in his true freshman season. He's also made a name for himself as a punt returner in his first two seasons (29 returns for 223 yards in 2015, 19 returns for 195 yards in 2016), including a 69-yard return for a touchdown against ACC rival Florida State in 2016. Alexander missed about half of the 2017 season with leg and hand injuries, but managed to start six of seven games played on the year (19 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups) and was named honorable mention All-ACC.",6.7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaire-alexander/3200414c-4529-1426-87b5-71774446f980

The coaches moved him to center in 2016, where he started 11 games (missing two with an injury) and garnering third-team All-Big Ten honors in the process.

In 2015, Davis was a Freshman All-SEC selection, starting nine of 13 games, making 56 tackles, two for loss, while leading the team with three interceptions and breaking up eight others. He played through injuries as a sophomore, starting 10 of 12 games played and breaking up 10 passes (46 stops, two for loss). Davis was a first-team All-SEC pick in 2017, starting 13 games, making 36 stops, intercepting one pass, and leading the Tigers with 11 pass breakups.

Rashaan Evans,"Some in Evans' hometown of Auburn, Alabama, did not appreciate his signing with the Tide as a top high school recruit. Those with priorities in the wrong place threatened his family's business and made their lives difficult. Now he's looking to become a star in 2017; in fact, in February Evans tweeted that he would win the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker. After sitting behind future pros like Reuben Foster for three years, he was ready to meet that promise. Evans was a second-team All-SEC pick in 2017, starting 12 games, tying for the team lead with 74 tackles, leading the team with 13 tackles for loss, making six sacks, and breaking up three passes. In the team's two playoff games in 2016 (his only starts of the year), Evans made 18 tackles from an inside linebacker position. He had 53 total for the year, including four sacks, six quarterback hurries, and a forced fumble in 14 games. Evans had to bide his time like many highly-recruited players coming to play for Nick Saban. The Parade All-American and five-star prospect actually played significantly as a true freshman on special teams in 13 games (15 tackles, two for loss, sack; team-leading 12 special teams tackles). Evans again mostly played as a special teamer and reserve outside linebacker in 2015, though his two sacks against Clemson in the national championship victory that season put him on scouts' radars.",6.7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashaan-evans/32004556-4161-7192-2696-b2fabd26bf91
Minkah Fitzpatrick,"Most Tide players, no matter how highly sought after coming out of high school, have to watch from the sidelines for their first year or two. Fitzpatrick got on the field right away in 2015, starting 10 times at the ""star"" position in 14 appearances and earning Freshman All-American and Freshman All-SEC notice (45 tackles, three for loss, 11 pass break-ups.) He used his sticky hands and speed to return both of his interceptions against Texas A&M that year for touchdowns and helped Alabama win a national title with two break-ups against Clemson in the championship game. Fitzpatrick played star early in 2016 and then moved to safety when senior Eddie Jackson was injured. The result? He led the team with six interceptions and 186 interception return yards, returning two more pick-sixes to set the school career record with four. He was named a first-team All-American by multiple outlets for his efforts (66 tackles, five TFL, seven pass break-ups).

Derrius Guice,"In most cases, it would be tough for a team to lose an excellent backfield talent like Leonard Fournette. Fournette's injuries in 2016, however, gave Guice the opportunity to prove he could handle the starting job. He used his exceptional balance, violent running style, and speed to lead the SEC in rushing (1,387 yards) and rushing touchdowns for running backs (15) despite starting just six of 12 games played. The first-team All-SEC pick set a school record with 285 yards against Texas A&M and ranked fifth in the country with 7.6 yards per attempt on the year. He was named MVP of the Citrus Bowl with 138 yards and a score in the win over Louisville. Guice was banged-up himself early in the 2017 season, but managed to start 11 of 12 games played, receiving second-team All-SEC notice after rushing for 1,251 yards and 11 touchdowns on 237 carries (18 receptions, 124 yards, two touchdowns receiving). The five-star prospect from Baton Rouge (all-state pick with 1,341 rushing yards, 21 touchdowns, 617 receiving yards as a senior) plays with anger stored in his body since his father was murdered when he was seven. He played in every game as a true freshman in 2015, averaging 8.5 yards on 51 carries and scoring three times when Fournette was unavailable.

After redshirting in 2013, he has started all 37 games that UTEP has played to the left of the center. Hernandez brings power and relatively light feet for his size, which earned him Freshman All-Conference USA honors in 2014, honorable mention all-conference recognition from league coaches in 2015, and first team All-C-USA accolades the following year.

He earned first-team AP All-American and first-team All-Big Ten honors as a 13-game starter with 48 tackles, a forced fumble, and a blocked kick. He redshirted in 2014, and then moved from receiver to cornerback in the spring of 2015 and served in a reserve role on defense for two seasons behind a talented set of Hawkeyes cornerbacks.

Harold Landry,"There was an inkling throughout the 2015 season that Landry was ready to break out as one of the top defensive ends in college football in his junior year; he did just that. After regularly contributing through his freshman year (11 tackles, 1.5 for loss in 13 games), the powerful end took over as the regular starter the last nine games of his sophomore year, garnering honorable mention All-ACC honors (15.5 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks, three forced fumbles). He took the next step in 2016, finishing in the top five nationally with 22 tackles for loss, 16.5 sacks, and seven forced fumbles. Landry started 12 of 13 games played and received multiple All-American honors as well as first-team All-ACC notice for his play. In a bit of a surprise, Landry returned to use his quickness off the line, change of direction skills, and supreme hustle for B.C. in his senior year instead of going to the NFL. His numbers dipped a bit in 2017, as he played in just nine games due to an ankle injury. Landry still earned third-team All-ACC recognition with 38 stops, 8.5 tackles for loss, five sacks, and two pass breakups.",6.7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/harold-landry/32004c41-4e15-9704-c65c-9a07b28af620
Baker Mayfield,"Mayfield finished his career as one of the most decorated quarterbacks in college football history, topping it off by winning the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Davey O'Brien Award, and the Big 12 Championship and a spot in the 2017 College Football Playoff. Mayfield completed 70.5 percent of his passes (285-of-404), throwing 43 touchdowns against just six interceptions (also rushing for 311 yards and five scores). The Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year led the nation in pass efficiency by a large margin (setting a NCAA record that he himself set the previous year) and yards per pass attempt (11.8), and finished in the top five of pretty much every other passing category. He was an all-state pick from Texas, but his lack of size scared major college programs away. He began his college days in Lubbock, walking on at Texas Tech. In his one and only season there, Mayfield started seven of eight games played, winning Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year (218-of-340, 64.1 percent complete, 2,315 yards, 12 touchdowns, nine interceptions). Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury decided to open up the starting competition, so Mayfield left campus to find a new home. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer student to Oklahoma (eventually, Big 12 coaches approved a rule that gave Mayfield an extra year of eligibility to make up for the lost season, as he was a walk-on that never received a scholarship offer from Tech). Finally on the field as the No. 1 starter in 2015, Mayfield became a second-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting, and was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He also won the Burlsworth Trophy as the nation's top player who began his career as a walk-on after completing 68.1 percent of his passes (269-of-395) for 3,700 yards and 36 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. In addition to winning Burlsworth Trophy again in 2016, Mayfield was first-team All-Big 12, finished third in Heisman voting, and was a finalist for the Maxwell and Davey O'Brien Awards after leading the FBS in passing efficiency (196.4 rating, ranked first with 70.9 completion percentage, 3,965 yards, 40 touchdowns, eight interceptions). While his completion percentage was aided by horizontal throws, his mobility helped him find secondary targets and his ability to throw passes over the top of defenses also led him to lead the FBS with 11.1 yards per attempt. Mayfield was arrested for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing/resisting arrest in February 2017. He was not suspended for those actions, though he was required to participate in alcohol education classes and community service.",6.7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/baker-mayfield/32004d41-5948-3453-e6ac-1ecff99fdcf6
Justin Reid,"It's easy to notice Reid on the field before being aware that his brother is former LSU All-American and NFL Pro Bowl safety Eric Reid, as his physical nature and athleticism pop out immediately. The all-state pick and four-star prospect from Louisiana played in 12 games as freshman, making 23 tackles, intercepting a pass, and breaking up one other as a reserve. Reid contributed in 13 games as a sophomore, starting 10 and earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors (57 tackles, four for loss, seven pass breakups). He followed his brother‚Äôs example by garnering second-team Associated Press All-American accolades in 2017, while also receiving a first-team all-conference nod, by starting 11 of 14 games, compiling 99 tackles, 6.5 for loss, five interceptions, and six pass breakups.

Josh Rosen,"One of the top recruits of the 2015 class, Rosen decided to stay close to home to play his ball in Westwood. He was a first-team USA Today All-American as a high school senior, throwing for 3,186 yards and 29 touchdowns while his St. John Bosco squad won the California State Championship. UCLA coaches saw enough of his talent in the spring of 2015 (he graduated from high school one semester early) that they made him the first Bruin freshman opening-weekend starter ever. He won Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and several Freshman All-American honors after setting several school records and completing 60 percent (292-487) of his passes for 3,668  yards and 23 touchdowns (11 interceptions). Despite being only a freshman, he was in command of the offense and used his NFL size and arm to sling the ball all over the field. Rosen's sophomore season had its peaks (400 passing yards against Arizona State) and valleys (three interceptions vs. Texas A&M), and eventually ended with a season-ending injury to his throwing shoulder after six starts (59.3 completion percentage, 1,915 yards, 10 touchdowns, five interceptions). The surgery to his shoulder was not considered major, so he was throwing effectively in spring 2017 practices. Rosen had the performance of the year in the season's opening weekend, leading the Bruins in an amazing 45-44 comeback win with 491 passing yards and four touchdowns. He struggled over a four-game stretch at the start of the Pac-12 season, throwing eight of his 10 interceptions on the year. He did earn second-team All-Pac-12 notice, however, by completing 62.6 percent of his passes (283-452), throwing 26 touchdowns, and ranking second in the country with 341.5 passing yards a game (3,756 total). Rosen also suffered two concussions during the year, missing one regular season contest and their bowl game against Kansas State.",6.7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-rosen/3200524f-5335-7433-3207-a02a4e884405
Isaiah Wynn,"Wynn's short, stout, powerful build and mobility make his NFL future at guard, but his versatility has helped him meet the team's need at left tackle. He was a second-team All-American and first-team All-SEC selection in 2017, starting all 15 games on the outside to lead the way for the team's excellent running backs and protect freshman quarterback Jake Fromm. Wynn was a four-star recruit and top-10 guard prospect nationally out of Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Florida before joining the Bulldogs. He played in 11 games as a true freshman, starting once as a second tight end. Wynn began his sophomore year at the left guard spot, starting eight games there before moving over one spot to his left for the remaining five games. The transfer of Tyler Catalina from Western Carolina to Georgia forced Wynn to slide back to the left guard spot in 2016, where he started 12 times (missing one game due to injury).",6.7,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-wynn/32005759-4e13-1632-c695-6334e59630f9
Marcus Davenport,"A hometown performer, Davenport was a three-sport athlete at San Antonio's Stevens High School (football, basketball, sprinter for track and field). The tall and long-limbed edge defender got stronger throughout his career at UTSA. He played in the first 11 games of his true freshman season with the Roadrunners (missed the finale due to injury), collecting 14 tackles, three of which were sacks. Davenport was voted an honorable mention all-conference performer in 2015, starting 11 games, posting 49 tackles, 7.5 for loss, four sacks, three pass break-ups, and two forced fumbles on the year. Listed as a defensive end, Davenport made plays as a stand-up rusher in his junior season, starting 12 of 13 games played, making 68 tackles, 10 for loss, and a team-best 6.5 sacks and eight quarterback hurries. His 11 tackles, 1.5 for loss and a sack against Texas A&M in 2016 put him on the national radar.",6.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-davenport/32004441-5600-4893-5029-0862a4795062
Mike Gesicki,"Gesicki is a phenomenal athlete at the tight end position, and colleges saw that aspect of his makeup while inspecting his high school career: All-American, top-15 prospect at tight end (33 receptions, 530 yards, four touchdowns receiving); New Jersey Player of the Year, school's all-time leading scorer in basketball (1,867 points) and state slam dunk contest winner; four-time letter-winner in volleyball. Penn State reeled him in for the 2014 season, playing in all 13 games (one start) in his first season (11 catches for 114 yards). He started eight of 12 games in 2015, compiling 13 throws for 125 yards and his first touchdown. Gesicki used his size, athleticism, and soft hands to benefit from the team's improvement on offense in 2016, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league coaches by starting all 14 games and finishing among the top tight ends in the country in receiving (48 receptions, 679 yard, five scores).",6.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-gesicki/32004745-5349-0798-d83d-d46852aa6fbb
Mike Hughes,"An all-state pick from Bern, North Carolina, Hughes signed on with home-state UNC for the 2015 season. He played in 11 games as a reserve that year, making 12 tackles and breaking up three passes. Hughes was suspended in October, however, for violating team rules after being part of an incident at a fraternity house. His time with the Tar Heels was over, so he attended Garden City Community College in 2016, earning national junior college All-American honors with 47 tackles, two interceptions, six pass breakups, and three return touchdowns. UCF Head Coach Scott Frost convinced Hughes to join UCF for the 2017 season, and his play was a big reason for the team's undefeated record. He started 12 of 13 contests, garnering first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors as a defensive back (44 tackles, four interceptions -- one returned for a touchdown, team-high 11 pass breakups) and second-team accolades as a returner (20 attempts, 635 yards, two touchdowns on kick returns; 13 attempts, 233 yards, one touchdown on punt returns).",6.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-hughes/32004855-4754-2699-7172-bccecb0f72e2
Maurice Hurst,"Hurst is the son a former NFL cornerback of the same name, though Nicole Page, the former Patriots cheerleader has been the only parent the younger Maurice has ever known. In fact, Maurice, Junior wears jersey 73 because it is the opposite of the number 37 his dad wore. The two-time All-Massachusetts high school football pick redshirted his first year in Ann Arbor. In 2014, he played seven games as a reserve (three tackles, one for loss). Four starts came his way in 13 games played during his sophomore season, and he responded with 35 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and three sacks. While Hurst isn't the biggest of tackles, he stays square against double-teams and his get-off and hustle outside the box helped him make 34 stops, 11.5 for loss, and 4.5 sacks as a junior.

Hayden Hurst,"Hurst's athletic career was on a different path at first, as the Pittsburgh Pirates drafted him in the 17th round for the 2012 Major League Draft as a pitcher. He spent two years at rookie ball in the Gulf Coast League (hitting .245 at first base in 2014) before trying to get back to football. Hurst walked on for the Gamecocks in the summer of 2015, playing in 12 games as a receiver and tight end, starting once, and making eight catches for 106 yards. He became a star in 2016, starting all 13 games at tight end and setting school records at the position for receptions (48) and yards (616) by consistently nabbing everything thrown his way and outmuscling defenders downfield (he scored one touchdown as well). Hurst was the first sophomore in USC history to be a team captain, albeit as a 23 year-old.

Lamar Jackson,"In a time where some players (and their parents) seek the limelight above all else, Jackson and his family have stayed away from the distractions. Jackson's father, Lamar, Sr., passed away in a car accident when Lamar was young, but even throughout the Heisman Trophy-winning 2016 season, Lamar and his mother, Felicia Jones, limited their media exposure. Of course, Jackson got plenty of exposure during his sophomore season, not only winning the Heisman but also Davey O'Brien and Maxwell Awards, as well as the ACC Player of the Year. Jackson's vision and speed as a runner helped him set a school record with 1,571 rushing yards (ranked 10th in the FBS) and 21 touchdowns on 260 carries. His cannon arm helped him pass for 3,543 yards (230-of-409, 56.2 completion percentage) for 30 touchdowns against nine interceptions. Jackson struggled throwing in the team's final three games, all losses (48 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions). Jackson played well in his junior season, as well, finishing third in the Heisman voting and earning second-team AP All-American, ACC Offensive Player of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors. He completed 59.1 percent of his passes (254-of-430) for 3,660 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions (four in the team's bowl loss to Mississippi State). Jackson also ran for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns (both in the top 10 nationally) on 232 carries, while finishing atop the FCS with 405 yards of total offense per game. In his first season with the Cardinals, Jackson started nine of 12 games (once at running back, against Auburn).

McGlinchey played in every game as a redshirt freshman, starting the team's Music City Bowl win over LSU at right tackle. He started all 13 games on the right side again as a sophomore before moving to left tackle for his junior season.

He got work as a true freshman (64 rush, 410 yards, five TD; 7 receptions, 106 yards, TD), playing in eight games and gaining a start in the Belk Bowl against Louisville. Michel was the team's Offensive MVP and earned the Charley Trippi Most Versatile Player Award as a sophomore by running for 1,161 yards and eight scores on 219 rushes and 270 yards and three touchdowns on 26 receptions. The hits kept coming in 2016, as the team captain ran behind his pads, broke ankles and accelerated into the open field on his way to 840 yards and four scores on 152 carries (22 receptions, 149 yards, one TD). Michel won Offensive MVP award in the Liberty Bowl win over TCU by gaining 87 rushing yards and 39 receiving yards while scoring twice.

His uncle, Damon Mays, also played college ball (receiver at Missouri) and in the NFL. Scouts are high on Isaiah's pro promise due to his size and tenacious nature. He also received the athleticism genes, starring in high school football (27 yards per reception, 12 touchdowns, seven interceptions, nine blocked punts as a senior) and track (state champ in 110 and 300-meter hurdles, 4x400 relay) in Arizona. Oliver made a splash as a true freshman, playing in all 13 games and starting three (19 tackles, six pass breakups). While he only started twice in 2016 behind 2017 NFL Draft pick Ahkello Witherspoon, he made 25 tackles, intercepted a pass, and broke up 13 passes. He also returned punts the second half of the season (14 returns, 164 yards, one touchdown). Oliver became a star in his own right in his junior year, garnering first-team All-Pac-12 honors with 27 tackles, two interceptions, and 13 pass breakups despite missing time with a leg injury.

Billy Price,"Price was actually the Associated Press Division 1 Co-Defensive Player of the Year in Ohio as a high school senior, but moved to the offensive line during his redshirt freshman season because he thought he was ""too meticulous."" Though he suited up at center on the scout team, coaches moved him to guard, where he started all 15 games (first three at left guard, final 12 at right) on the national champions in 2014. Price earned third-team All-Big Ten honors as an every-week starter at left guard the following year, and then first-team honors on the right side as a junior team captain. He also was named second-team All-American by the Associated Press, Walter Camp Foundation, and other outlets by not only mauling his opponent with excellent upper and lower body strength but also being effective on the move for traps and other run plays. Price won the Remington Trophy as the nation's top center in 2017 and was a unanimous first-team All-American.

However, he missed the team's two playoff games that year due to a suspension for failing drug tests. Cain missed spring practices due to the suspension, as well. He bounced back as a sophomore, however, improving his reliability as a receiver and teammate. In 15 games as a reserve, Cain averaged 19.1 yards on his 38 receptions (724 yards in total) and scored nine times using his speed, vertical, and learning from teammate Mike Williams on how to create separation at the top of his route.

The long, lean rush linebacker with excellent straight-line speed responded with seven tackles and two forced fumbles in the win, showing the playmaking ability scouts expected to see. Carter had been productive in his junior season (44 tackles, five sacks, 13 pressures in 13 games, with nine starts), but much more had been expected of him since arriving between the hedges. He came through with a second-team All-SEC senior campaign, starting 10 of 15 games played, making 61 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, and a team-high three forced fumbles while often playing off the line of scrimmage. Carter was ranked as high as the second-best recruit in the country, and Georgia fans are thrilled to see the Norcross native (he led the team to a state title with 132 tackles, 40 for loss, six sacks as a senior) staying in-state. He was the team's Newcomer of the Year in his first year on campus, starting five of 13 games played, making 41 tackles, seven for loss, and 4.5 sacks.

SEC coaches voted him second-team all-conference in 2017, as he started 12 of 13 games played, posting 49 stops, 3.5 for loss, an interception, and 10 pass breakups.",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donte-jackson/32004a41-4313-6548-d4ba-65e7b5a50e73
Kerryon Johnson,"Johnson was the winner of Alabama's Mr. Football award after his senior year (1,659 rushing yards, 25 touchdowns) after leading his team to their third straight state title (he set a state record with six touchdowns in the championship game). The top-five running back prospect nationally chose Auburn over Alabama and many others that offered him scholarships. Johnson played in 13 games as a true freshman, starting once (52 carries, 208 yards, three touchdowns; 14 receptions, 159 yards; 14 kick returns, 386 yards). In 2016, Johnson shared carries with fellow sophomore Kamryn Pettway, finishing with 182 totes for 919 yards and 11 scores (17 catches, 125 yards; 12 kick returns, 267 yards in 12 games). He took over the lead-back role in his junior season, earning second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-SEC honors with 1,391 yards and 18 touchdowns on 285 carries in 12 games (plus 24 catches for 194 yards and two touchdowns).

Christian Kirk,"One of the top receivers in his recruiting class, Kirk decided to roll with Texas A&M over home-state Arizona State, and many others. He accounted for over 3,000 all-purpose yards and 40 touchdowns on offense (he had two on interceptions and two on returns as well) as a senior. It didn't take him long to make an impact on campus, as he led the Aggies with 80 receptions, 1,009 receiving yards, and eight total touchdowns, as well as being their top returner (385 kickoff return yards, 24.4 average on punt returns, two touchdowns). Kirk's combination of a sturdy running back frame, excellent open-field agility, and toughness with the ball in his hands made him a 2016 third-team Associated Press All-American and three-way first-team All-SEC (all-purpose, receiver, return specialist). He started 12 of 13 games as a sophomore, leading the SEC with 83 receptions for 928 yards and nine scores (along with eight rushes for 35 yards). Kirk also led the FBS with three punt return touchdowns (21.7-yard average) on the year. He earned second-team All-SEC honors in 2017, starting all 13 games and leading the Aggies with 71 receptions for 919 yards and 10 touchdowns (including 13 receptions, 189 yards, 3 TD vs Wake Forest in the Belk Bowl).

Shaquille Leonard,"As the half-brother of former Clemson linebacker Anthony Waters, Leonard expected to one day suit up for the Tigers. Clemson only offered him a preferred walk-on invitation, however, so he decided to take the ride at SCSU. Leonard has played like an FBS recruit for the Bulldogs, playing the run inside, coming off the edge as a pass rusher, and making plays in coverage. He garnered MEAC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2016 with 124 tackles, 14.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks, two interceptions, three pass break-ups, and four forced fumbles. He posted 70 stops the previous year, 13.5 for loss, five sacks, and two interceptions to earn a first-team all-conference selection.

Kolton Miller,"Bruins coaches paid Miller the ultimate compliment when they moved him to the most important position on the field: left tackle. Protecting quarterback Josh Rosen was the top priority, so placing Miller on the passer's blind side showed confidence in him. He repaid them by starting all 13 games at the position, garnering second-team All-Pac-12 recognition. Miller was coming off a shortened sophomore season where he started five games at right tackle before missing the rest of the year with a foot injury. He played in 13 games as a redshirt freshman in 2015, starting five games at right tackle. Great things were expected from Miller in Westwood after they signed the four-star recruit who was named an All-Sacramento Metro pick as a senior.",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kolton-miller/32004d49-4c37-1062-3eb9-b8a69d38d862

Moore also led the team in receiving as a sophomore, grabbing 41 passes for 637 yards and six touchdowns, while serving as the top kick returner (15 returns, 334 yards). The Pennsylvania all-state high school receiver and former four-star recruit stepped into a starting role as a true freshman, beginning the final 10 games of 12 played (25 receptions, 357 yards, three touchdowns).",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-j-moore/32004d4f-4f27-2423-f0b4-728a741b03cb

His effort in her name as a 13-game starter and honorable mention All-Conference USA selection in 2017, leading the Golden Eagles with 87 tackles, three for loss, three interceptions, and 10 pass breakups. The previous season, Moore was a reserve defensive back, credited with 17 tackles, two interceptions, and two pass breakups. The Quitman, Mississippi transferred to USM from Pearl River Community College after the 2015 season. He was a first-team all-state pick his sophomore year as a defensive back (72 tackles, one interception, eight pass breakups) and kick returner (averaged 39.6 yards per kickoff return with one touchdown).

Rashaad Penny,"Penny and NCAA all-time leading rusher Donnel Pumphrey formed a dynamic duo at running back for the Aztecs for three years, even discovering they were distantly related. After Pumphrey went off to the NFL as a fourth-round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles, it was Penny's time to shine. He led the nation with 2,248 rushing yards and scored 23 touchdowns on 289 carries, finishing fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and garnering first-team All-American and All-Mountain West honors. Penny also caught 19 passes for 135 yards and two scores and scored twice on kickoff returns, averaging 30.6 yards on 17 attempts (ranked fifth in the FBS). He also scored a 70-yard touchdown on one of his two punt returns for the year. Penny used his compact, strong build and good straight-line speed to run for 1,018 yards and 11 touchdowns (on just 136 carries) despite his cousin running for over 2,000 yards himself in 2016. He also ranked fourth in the country with 31.2 yards per kick return (two touchdowns), running at top speed with purpose after securing the ball. Penny starred for the team in the Mountain West Championship Game (16 att., 117 yards, two scores rushing; 2 receptions, 13 yards; 2 att., 113 yards kick returns), earning Offensive MVP honors. He is a two-time Mountain West Special Teams Player of the Year and first-team all-conference specialist, first garnering the award by finishing second in the FBS with three kick return touchdowns and a 33.5-yard average return. Penny was a valued reserve back, as well, getting 61 carries for 368 yards and four scores and catching eight passes for 120 yards and a touch. The Norwalk, California native and top 50 high school running back recruit was the team's kick returner as a true freshman, averaging a respectable 25 yards an attempt.

Harrison Phillips,"Phillips' background as the 2013 Nebraska Gatorade Player of the Year and a junior wrestling champion is exactly what NFL scouts are looking for. Add in the play he's put on tape over the past couple of seasons and it was no surprise when he decided to leave school early for the NFL. Phillips played in six games as a reserve in his first year on the Farm (nine tackles, two sacks). He missed all but one game of the 2015 season, unfortunately, because of a knee injury suffered in the season opener. The following year, Phillips garnered honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors after starting 12 games, making 46 stops, 9.5 for loss, and 6.5 sacks. Amazingly, he led Stanford in tackles (103, 17 for loss, 7.5 sacks, as well as two forced fumbles) from the interior as a junior in 2017, which led the Associated Press to vote him third-team All-American. Phillips was also first-team all-conference and named a member of the America Football Coaches Association Good Works Team.",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/harrison-phillips/32005048-4921-5142-5ef5-133a36dda72f
Tim Settle,"Named as one of the top 40 overall prospects in the 2015 class by multiple high school recruiting services, Settle was a great in-state hold (Manassas) for Virginia Tech. The Washington Post All-Metro pick redshirted his first year in Blacksburg to improve his build and conditioning, and was a reserve for all 14 games in 2016 (17 tackles, blocked kick) before making his impact as a sophomore in 2017. Settle used his quickness off the snap and wide shoulders to earn second-team All-ACC honors at nose tackle. He started all 13 games inside, posting 36 stops, 12.5 for loss, and four sacks.",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tim-settle/32005345-5450-9598-7639-a7d691023bd2
Courtland Sutton,"Sutton was ranked as a safety coming out of high school, where he excelled on both sides of the football. The SMU coaching staff saw his potential as a big-bodied receiver, however, and gave him a chance to show his stuff as a true freshman in 2014. But after two games (two catches, 27 yards), Sutton sat the rest of the year with an injury, receiving a medical redshirt. He came back with a vengeance in 2015, garnering USA Today Freshman All-American status by starting all 12 games and topping the squad with 49 receptions for 862 yards and nine touchdowns. He moonlighted with the SMU basketball team after that season (three games, three points, two rebounds). Sutton was a first-team All-AAC pick as a sophomore, ranking among the nation's top 20 in the major categories (76 catches, 1,246 yards, 10 touchdowns). His NFL size, downfield physicality, strong hands, and strider's deep speed could have led him to the next level after last season, but he chose to return to school for his fourth year. His play in 2017 only strengthened his draft stock, as the first-team all-conference selection grabbed 68 passes for 1,085 yards and 12 scores, pairing with Trey Quinn as dual 1,000-yard pass-catchers.",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/courtland-sutton/32005355-5433-3526-b2bf-88d6b83781c0

His mother, Martha, passed away when an abscessed tooth led to liver and kidney failure. Thomas' father, Earl, died of a heart attack a year later. Thomas finished high school as a three-sport athlete (football, basketball, track) and moved on to Nassau Community College for two years. He was rated the second-best junior college tight end nationally after a solid sophomore season (23 catches, 433 yards, three touchdowns in eight games). Indiana came calling, and he played a minor role, starting once in 13 games played (three catches, 28 yards).",6.3,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ian-thomas/32005448-4f19-7015-e78d-8df0c5551bf1
Connor Williams,"Williams joined the Longhorns after being named a second-team 6A All-State pick by the media as a high school senior. Even though he was ""just"" a three-star recruit coming out of the north Dallas suburbs, Williams proved himself a worthy starter at left tackle for all 12 games as a freshman. He was a freshman All-American pick by multiple outlets, as well as an honorable mention All-Conference selection by Big 12 coaches. Williams' strength in the run game and elite agility in pass protection made coaches, NFL scouts, and media outlets name him one of the best tackles in college football in 2016. He earned consensus first-team All-American and first-team All-Conference accolades after starting 11 of 12 games at left tackle. His junior season was marred by injury, however; Williams started just five games (first three games, final two regular season games) at left tackle due to a left knee injury.

Mark Andrews,"Andrews has type 1 diabetes, which is controllable (if unpredictable) with proper diet and medication. NFL players such as quarterback Jay Cutler, defensive end Michael Sinclair, and others have played through this condition in the past. He has had multiple episodes where his blood sugar got too low and he became unresponsive. Andrews' talent as a receiving tight end has shown through the past two seasons, moving like a receiver in space despite being 6-foot-5 and outweighing most wideouts by 50 pounds. He redshirted in 2014, then broke out as a freshman the following year with a second-team All-Big 12 (coaches) season. Andrews played in all 13 game (one start), catching 19 throws for 318 yards and seven scores. He started 11 games the following year, playing through a shoulder AC joint sprain and some dropped passes to garner first-team all-conference honors with 31 receptions for 489 yards and seven scores. Andrews finished his career as the nation's top tight end, winning the John Mackey Award and earning first-team All-American and All-Big 12 accolades.

The four-star recruit ranked in the top 10 nationally at outside linebacker after being named All-Ohio and the state's Division IV Co-Defensive Player of the Year. But even talented player like Baker have to wait their turn with a bevy of veterans ahead of him on the depth chart. Rather than redshirting in 2015, however, he played in the final seven games of the year as a reserve (three tackles). He thought he might have to wait another year to before getting his shot as a starter, but an injury to Dante Booker put Baker in the starting Will spot in 2016. He garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors, making 83 tackles, 9.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks while starting 12 of 13 games. He also intercepted two passes, including one against Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield that he returned 68 yards for a score; Baker also had seven tackles, 1.5 for loss, in that contest.

Orlando Brown,"Orlando Brown, Junior is a huge man, just like his late father, Orlando ""Zeus"" Brown, who played in the NFL for 11 seasons. Brown's father passed away at the age of 40 from diabetic ketoacidosis, so now he plays for his memory -- though his father wished he wouldn't. The top 30 offensive tackle prospect redshirted his first year with the Sooners despite his size behind seniors Tyrus Thompson and Daryl Williams. Brown lived up to the hype in 2015 when given his chance, starting all 13 games at left tackle, earning Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Big 12 accolades. He used his elite length, massive frame, and improving agility to start every game in his sophomore campaign, second-team Associated Press All-American and Big 12 Offensive Lineman of the Year honors.

He grew up in nearby Cave Springs and made headlines at Cave Springs High by running for over 5,400 yards and 79 touchdowns over his junior and senior seasons. The top-50 overall recruit garnered many honors as a true freshman in 2014, including SEC Freshman of the Year, first-team All-SEC, and was named to various Freshman All-American squads. In 13 games (eight starts), Chubb rushed for 1,547 yards on just 219 carries (7.1 per) and 14 scores. He set a SEC bowl record and was named Belk Bowl MVP with 266 yards on 33 carries against Louisville. Chubb continued his run of 13 straight 100-yard games midway through his sophomore (747 yards, seven touchdowns in six starts), but a left knee injury (multiple ligaments, but no ACL) on the first play of scrimmage against Tennessee. Surprisingly, he returned to play every game in 2016, starting 11. He was not clearly not as explosive a runner as he was pre-injury, but the team captain still presented the power and enough speed to finish with 1,130 yards and eight touchdowns on 224 carries. Chubb finished his career strong, starting  14 games, leading the national runner-up Bulldogs with 1,345 yards on the ground, and scoring 15 times on 223 carries (plus four receptions, 30 yards receiving) and garnered second-team All-SEC honors to finish second in the school's annals in rushing.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-chubb/32004348-5503-3942-d8b2-181bd658412e

After redshirting in 2013, he stepped in to start 12 games at left tackle, taking over for second-round NFL Draft pick Joel Bitonio. Corbett was named a team captain as a sophomore in 2015 and garnered honorable mention All-Mountain West honors after starting every game at left tackle. Corbett started every game at left tackle again (though like Bitonio, his NFL future is as a hard-nosed but athletic guard) as a junior, playing well enough to gain second-team all-conference from league coaches.

He was poised for a great junior year before injuries caused him to miss all but three games. He missed the opener due to injury, started the next two games at left tackle but suffered a broken left foot. Crosby started 12 of 13 games played in 2015 at right tackle, one year after stepping into the starting lineup because of injuries in 2014.

Duke Dawson,"Even though Cross City, Florida is closer to Gainesville (51.6 miles) than Tallahassee (97.1 miles), Dawson and his father rooted for the Seminoles growing up. FSU, Alabama, and others couldn't match Florida's push for the first-team All-State defender, however, so rooting interests were set aside. Gators coaches got Dawson on the field right away, playing him in 11 games with one start at safety as a true freshman (14 tackles, interception). He played in every game as a reserve in 2015 (10 tackles, forced fumble) before starting seven games as a nickel back (24 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one interception, led the Gators with seven pass breakups)--waiting to turn to be a full-time starter after corners Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson depart for the NFL. Dawson got his chance in 2017, garnering first-team All-SEC honors by starting all 11 games, collecting 34 stops, two for loss, a team-high four interceptions and nine pass breakups.

As fitting as his first name is, his last name is even more apt for his NFL future, as it is pronounced EDGE-eh-for. His edge rushing prowess was on full display in 2016, when he showed off a growing frame, closing speed, and a spin move to garner third-team All-ACC from league coaches and media with 50 tackles, 17 for loss, 10.5 sacks, an interception, three pass break-ups and two forced fumbles. He showed glimpses of that talent as a sophomore despite missing the first five games of the year with concussion symptoms. Ejiofor played in seven games that year, leading the team with 4.5 sacks among his 28 stops, 7.5 for loss.

Hamilton was again a regular starter in 2016 (13 of 14 games) but had career lows in all categories (34-506, one touchdown) despite an excellent performance against Wisconsin the Big Ten Championship Game (8-118). Hamilton had more production as a senior, garnering second-team All-Big Ten honors from coaches after catching 53 passes for 857 yards and nine touchdowns.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daesean-hamilton/32004841-4d20-0565-a51e-2028f6290d41
Da'Shawn Hand,"Hand was considered the number one high school recruit in the country in 2014, ahead of guys like Leonard Fournette, Myles Garrett, and Deshaun Watson. The two-time first-team USA Today All-American was also a state high school wrestling champion. He played in nine games as a true freshman, making seven stops including two sacks. Hand played in every game as a reserve in Alabama's deep defensive line rotation in their 2015 national championship season (16 stops, 6.5 for loss, three sacks), making an impact in the title game with two tackles for loss against Clemson. That depth kept him from starting again in 2016, but he was a regular contributor (21 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks) using his length, strength, and athleticism to factor in plays where he didn't collect a stat. Hand started nine of 11 games played in 2017, missing time with a minor knee injury but still recording 27 tackles, 3.5 for loss with three sacks. Hand was arrested for driving under the influence in July 2017, though he was actually found sleeping behind the wheel of the car while it was parked.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/da-shawn-hand/32004841-4e08-3056-e4d2-1b26ded29329
Desmond Harrison,"Harrison took a trip around the country to play high school football and basketball, finishing up at the Oak Ridge Military Academy in Greensboro. He spent two years at Contra Costa Community College, coming out as a first-team JUCO All-American. Harrison transferred to the University of Texas, where he played in seven games as a reserve and on special teams in 2013. In 2014, he was suspended from the team twice, failing to play in a single game. Harrison spent the next two years away from football before attending West Georgia for the 2017 season. He started nine of 10 games played as a senior at left tackle, garnering first-team All-Gulf South Conference and first-team AFCA All-American accolades.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/desmond-harrison/32004841-5257-8753-d1cd-baeb1f76617c
Jalyn Holmes,"With players like Joey Bosa, Nick Bosa, Tyquan Lewis, and Sam Hubbard on the Buckeyes, Holmes wasn't able to earn a start in his first three years on the team. He was still an important part of the line rotation, however, and was voted honorable mention All-Big Ten by league coaches and media after making 33 tackles, 8.5 for loss, and two sacks in 2016. He also had a pass breakup on Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield which led to a 68-yard touchdown for linebacker Jerome Baker. Holmes got nine starts in 14 games played as a senior, again receiving the honorable mention all-conference nod after accumulating 29 tackles, three for loss, two sacks, and three pass breakups. Holmes played in 11 games in 2014 and every game as a reserve in 2015, as well, posting 11 tackles each season. Ohio State signed him out of Virginia as a four-star and top-100 recruit nationally after he was credited with 21 sacks over his final two seasons and was an all-state tight end as a junior.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalyn-holmes/3200484f-4c56-2778-1cf6-38d9818b0ce8
Jamarco Jones,"Although Jones was a four-star recruit and top 100 prospect nationally, he was coming off a shoulder injury that cost him half of his senior year and needed to mature physically and mentally before knowing what it took to be a great player. For two years, he learned behind Taylor Decker, an eventual first-round pick for Detroit. Jones played in 10 games as a true freshman for the national champions, and then in all 13 games as the team's sixth lineman the following year. Once Decker departed, Jones proved he was ready to go, taking advantage of his length and quick feet to garner second-team All-Big Ten honors as the starting left tackle for every game. He garnered first-team all-conference honors as a senior, starting all 14 games at left tackle for the Big Ten Champion Buckeyes.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamarco-jones/32004a4f-4e40-4567-a754-a909b48a207f
Anthony Miller,"A Memphis product, Miller not only excelled at football in high school, but was also a state 110-meter hurdle champion and was a runner-up in the long jump. That athleticism didn't get on the field for the Tigers in 2013 (redshirted, winning the team's award for top scout player on offense) or 2014 (pre-season injury). Miller played in 12 games, starting four, when given the chance in 2015. He caught 47 passes for 694 yards and five touchdowns. Once Riley Ferguson came to campus, Miller was able to use his deep speed, strong hands, and physicality to their full potential. He was a second-team All-American Athletic Conference pick in his junior year, making 95 receptions for 1,434 yards and 14 touchdowns.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-miller/32004d49-4c14-0090-2d8a-386614adf145
Parry Nickerson,"A first-team all-state pick from Louisiana, Nickerson thought he would get a chance to play for his home-state team as a true freshman. But he had to redshirt with a knee injury after just one game, despite making seven stops and forcing a fumble in that one appearance. Nickerson bounced back for his sophomore campaign, earning honorable mention All-Conference USA and first-team Freshman All-American honors by starting 11 of 12 games played, compiling 51 tackles, 2.5 for loss, six interceptions (ranking seventh in the FBS), and six pass breakups. Nickerson returned to the starting lineup for all 12 games in 2015, recording 46 stops, 3.5 for loss, and a team-leading eight pass breakups. He earned all-conference recognition once again in 2016 (second team) after intercepting four passes and returning them for 171 yards (ranked fourth in the FBS). Nickerson also deflected nine passes and posted 29 tackles on the year.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/parry-nickerson/32004e49-4366-8282-8af2-87c86e4e6140
Derrick Nnadi,"Listed at 6-foot-1, 312 pounds, Nnadi is not the largest nose tackle in front of scouts during the 2017 season. Few will outwork him, however, as he was named a third-team All-ACC selection, compiling 56 tackles, 10 for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 13 starts. ACC coaches named him first-team all-conference in 2016 after earning the team's Defensive Most Improved Player award in the spring. Nnadi started 11 of 13 games played, fighting through an early-season ankle injury to be credited with 49 tackles from the middle, 10.5 for loss, and six sacks. He collected third-team all-conference accolades from league media as a sophomore, starting every game (45 tackles, two sacks), following a true freshman campaign that saw him on the field for nine games (18 tackles, six against Georgia Tech's triple-option rushing attack in the ACC Championship Game). Despite his lack of height, Nnadi was considered a top 10 defensive tackle prospect nationally after amassing 33 sacks in his final two years of high school ball.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derrick-nnadi/32004e4e-4115-7287-94ee-cd56344264cf
Joe Noteboom,"Noteboom was a lean and athletic honorable mention all-state pick from Plano, Texas before signing on with the Horned Frogs. The three-time All-Academic Big 12 pick has not missed a game since redshirting the 2013 season. He played as a reserve in 2014, then took over the right tackle spot for all 13 games as a sophomore. Noteboom moved to the blind side for 2016, starting every game and showing agility in pass protection that NFL scouts admire at the position despite growing into his frame. Big 12 coaches voted him honorable mention all-conference as a senior, as he started all 14 games at the left tackle spot.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-noteboom/32004e4f-5405-9326-71bf-6ca4d7f0dd6d
Uchenna Nwosu,"Nwosu had difficulty deciding whether he wanted to play football. He played some middle school ball, but quit and did not play until his sophomore year in high school. He was a Los Angeles all-city pick as a senior, earning a scholarship from one of his hometown schools. Nwosu played in 12 games as a reserve his true freshman year (nine tackles), but was sent home before the team's Holiday Bowl appearance for fighting with a teammate. He did not enroll in school in the spring of 2015, but realized he missed the game so he returned for the fall. Nwosu started once and played in all 14 games as a sophomore (31 tackles, 1.5 for loss, eight stops vs Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game) before taking over at outside linebacker full-time in 2016 (53 tackles, 7.5 for loss, three sacks, five pass break-ups).",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/uchenna-nwosu/32004e57-4f59-3274-851b-d601b6909b91
Brian O'Neill,"O'Neill's athleticism helped him win honors as Delaware High School Defensive Player of the Year (five sacks, 13 pass deflections, also 33 receptions, 614 yards, and eight touchdowns as a tight end) in football and the state's basketball Player of the Year award. His talent came as no surprise since his father was a running back at Dartmouth and his mother a swimmer at Northeastern University. O'Neill was a tight end during his redshirt season in 2014 and the following spring but moved over to offensive tackle before the 2015 season. He played in all 13 games, starting the final 12 (one at left tackle, the rest at right tackle). O'Neill continued his improvement on the line, starting all 13 games at right tackle and earning second-team All-ACC from league coaches. Injuries on the line caused him to move to left tackle for his junior season, where he started all 12 games and garnered first-team all-conference honors. Pitt coaches used O'Neill' athleticism as an offensive weapon as a rusher (two scores, one on a lateral and the other on an end-around) and passer (0-for-2). He won the satirical ""Piesman Trophy"" in 2016 for one of his touchdowns.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brian-o-neill/32004f4e-4562-0476-e88b-0b8007f92aac
Dante Pettis,"You could say the Pettis family has some athletic prowess. Dante's father, Gary, played 11 seasons of major league baseball for four teams, winning five Gold Gloves as a centerfielder. His older cousin, Austin, was Boise State's all-time leading receiver before playing in the NFL for four seasons with the St. Louis Rams. Pettis was an all-conference high school football player at cornerback as a junior and receiver as a senior, while also playing hoops and competing at the California state track meet in the 200 meters and long jump. His athleticism got him on the field with the Huskies as a true freshman in a punt returner (28 att., 288 yards, TD) and part-time starting receiver (five starts in 13 games, 17 receptions, 259 yards, TD) role. Pettis excelled on special teams again as a sophomore, ranking fourth in the nation with 16.9 yards per punt return (16 att., 271 yards, two TD). He started eight of 13 games at receiver, as well (30 receptions, 414 yards, TD). Pettis combined with quarterback Jake Browning to explode on the national scene in 2016, displaying centerfielder-type hands as well as excellent toughness as a receiver, runner, and blocker. He ranked seventh in the FBS with 15 touchdown receptions and garnered second-team All-Pac-12 honors with 53 catches for 822 yards. His increased role on offense did not prevent him from making plays as a punt returner for the third straight season (25 att., 287 yards, two TD, ranked 10th in the FBS with 11.5 yards per return).",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dante-pettis/32005045-5473-5981-8eda-5f27db81c106
Frank Ragnow,"After the team's rout of Alcorn State in October 2016, Ragnow received devastating news: his father, Jon, had passed away from a heart attack. Ragnow did not miss a contest, however, and received many accolades for his play during the course of the difficult season. League media named him second-team All-SEC due to his sturdiness in pass protection and ability to move the line of scrimmage on run plays. He started 12 games in the pivot and one at right guard as a junior but decided to stay in college instead of heading to the NFL. Ragnow lined up for all 13 games at that right guard position in 2015, his sophomore season. As a true freshman from the far southwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area, Ragnow played in nine games at center. He played well enough to receive Freshman All-SEC and Freshman All-American honors.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/frank-ragnow/32005241-4731-6161-869a-6a328cc4c8b3
Martinas Rankin,"Rankin was the top junior college offensive tackle prospect nationally (a top-five overall recruit) after a successful two years at home-state Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. He waited a year to get on the field, redshirting the 2015 season. His play in 2016 as the team's full-time starter at left tackle, however, earned the respect of scouts and media alike. Despite starting just nine of 10 games played in his senior year at left tackle due to a high ankle sprain suffered against Auburn, Rankin was a first-team All-SEC pick in 2017. Rankin's length and lateral agility made him a tough blocker to beat on the outside, and he brings a strong punch and active feet in the run game, as well.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/martinas-rankin/32005241-4e65-4236-c318-271f54d7d958
Will Richardson,"Richardson's career at N.C. State had its hills and valleys, but he ended on a high note with a second-team All-ACC junior season before decided to take his game to the NFL. The team's top lineman started 10 games at right tackle in 2017, missing the first two due to suspension after an arrest for driving while intoxicated. It was his second suspension for that offense, as he was sat down for one game in his redshirt freshman season in 2015 (he started 11 games at right tackle that year.) The native of the Piedmont-Triad area of North Carolina started 10 of 12 games played at right tackle in 2016, missing time with an illness.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-richardson/32005249-4364-0708-66ca-dae763be1eba
Mason Rudolph,"Like many prospects for the 2018 NFL Draft, Rudolph grew up in a football family. His father, Brett, played at North Carolina in the 1980s. His brother, Logan, is a top 200 recruit that committed to play outside linebacker for Clemson starting in 2017. That background and support helped him excel in high school, where he was a finalist for South Carolina's Mr. Football Award as a senior (4,377 passing yards, 64 touchdowns, eight interceptions). It was expected that Rudolph would take a redshirt in 2014, but the Cowboys' starter fell to injury late in the year. He played in three games, starting two, led the team to a comeback win over rival Oklahoma. Rudolph was OSU's MVP in 2015, starting 12 games (missing most of that year's Bedlam due to injury), completing 62.3 percent of his passes for 3,770 yards and 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions. In his junior campaign, Rudolph stood tall in the pocket and earned honorable mention all-conference honors, distributing the ball to either sideline, as well as down the field, for 4,091 yards (ranking eighth in the FBS) on a 63.4 completion rate with 28 touchdowns -- but throwing just four interceptions in the process. While Rudolph is a pocket passer, he also had six rushing touchdowns in 2016. Rudolph finished his career by winning the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm and Sammy Baugh Awards while earning second-team All-Big 12 recognition. He led the FBS with 377 passing yards per game (4,904 total), completing 65 percent of his passes, finishing among the nation's leader with 37 touchdowns while throwing just nine interceptions.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mason-rudolph/32005255-4432-1216-a9be-28502c0847e4
Dalton Schultz,"Stanford has become a hotspot for tight ends, and Schultz is the next one in line with an NFL future. Head coach David Shaw called him the most ""complete"" tight end the team has had in recent years, as his height and hands make him a nice target over the middle, and he's growing into a solid in-line blocker. The four-star/top-100 recruit from Utah (31 receptions, 512 yards, nine touchdowns as senior) sat out the 2014 season as the Cardinal had a deep roster at the position. Schultz played in 14 games the next season, catching 10 passes for 121 yards and a score. He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick in 2016, grabbing 23 receptions for 222 yards and one touchdown. Schultz left Stanford for the NFL after a junior season that saw him gain first-team all-conference accolades by blocking for star back Bryce Love and nabbing 22 throws for 212 yards and three scores.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dalton-schultz/32005343-4864-7271-8c9c-893e6cc8875d
Nathan Shepherd,"A native of Ontario, Canada, Shepherd was a 205-pound linebacker in high school before attending Simon Fraser University. Over the next couple of years, he continued to grow, eventually playing in nine games as a redshirt freshman for the Clan in 2012 (20 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks). Eventually, he made his way to Kansas to play for the Tigers after an FHSU coach saw his highlight tape. In 2015, Shepherd was a third-team All-Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association selection after starting all 12 games (69 tackles, five for loss, three sacks, two blocked kicks). He was a second-team all-conference pick the next season, posting 61 tackles, 9.5 for loss, three sacks, and two forced fumbles. Shepherd ended his career with a second-team Associated Press Division II All-American senior campaign, also earning the MIAA Defensive Player of the Year award.

Braden Smith,"Given the size and strength Smith showed as a Kansas football all-star and state shot put/discus champion, as well as the top-rated guard recruit in the country, it was not a shock when he played in all 13 games of his true freshman year (starting against Wisconsin in the Outback Bowl) and landed on the Freshman All-SEC squad. He was a second-team All-SEC pick by league media at right guard in 2015 and received second and third-team All-American notice at that position as a junior while also picking up second-team all-conference recognition from SEC coaches. In Smith's final season, he was honored as a first-team All-American and All-SEC selection after starting all 14 games for the Tigers. Smith's athletic build, natural bend, and power make for a lethal combination that could allow him to play outside or inside in the NFL.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/braden-smith/3200534d-4908-0765-f244-89a603c3a555
Equanimeous St. Brown,"St. Brown does not have the typical NFL prospect background. His father, John Brown, was a two-time Mr. Universe and three-time Mr. World as a weightlifter. His mother is from Germany. He lived in France for a short time as a youth and went to a French school while living in California. But it was St. Brown's game that really got him noticed as a recruit, as he earned a top 100 overall prospect rankings after excelling his final two years (74 catches, 1,210 yards, 10 touchdowns) at Servite High School in Anaheim. Equanimeous (a form of equanimity, meaning to stay calm and cool under pressure) played in seven games as a freshman (one catch, eight receiving yards, blocked punt against USC), missing the final four with a shoulder injury. He and Deshone Kizer formed an alliance in 2016, however, allowing him to use his tall frame, huge catching radius, and long strides to lead the Irish with 58 receptions, 961 yards, and nine receiving touchdowns. Notre Dame's passing game went south with Brandon Winbush leading the offense, so St. Brown's statistics dropped (33 catches, 515 yards, four touchdowns). After his brother, Amon-Ra, decided to attend USC instead of UND as a five-star receiver recruit, Equanimeous' road to the NFL was paved.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/equanimeous-st-brown/32005354-4256-3610-e58a-b682f5824735
M.J. Stewart,"Stewart has been a starting cornerback for UNC the past two seasons, but his physicality and tackling ability may gain him time at nickel or safety at the next level. He was ranked both as a top-40 corner and safety nationally coming out of Virginia Beach after earning first-team All-Washington D.C. Metro notice. He played in 12 games as a key reserve his true freshman season, contributing 26 tackles, two interceptions, and four pass breakups. Stewart was voted second-team All-ACC by league media in 2015, tying for the conference lead with 18 passes defended (four picks, 14 deflections). He also had 62 tackles, 2.5 for loss, and a forced fumble on the year. Stewart again received all-conference notice as a junior, receiving honorable mention accolades from ACC media with 66 stops, 11 pass deflections, and two forced fumbles.

Kemoko Turay,"Turay only played two years of high school football because he attended a school without a program for his sophomore and junior seasons. He exploded as a senior (19 sacks) but only had two scholarship offers (Rutgers, James Madison). Turay redshirted in 2013 while honing his skills, which appeared to have paid off as he earned Freshman All-American honors. He played in all 13 games as a reserve, but led the team with 7.5 sacks (26 total tackles) and tied for the FBS lead with three blocked kicks. His production dropped off over the next two years, however. Turay started once in 11 games played in 2015 (nine tackles, two sacks) and played in eight games as a reserve in 2016 (three tackles, two sacks) after undergoing two surgeries on his right shoulder before the season. Back to health in 2017, he started nine of 12 games played, compiled 65 tackles, seven for loss, four sacks, two fumble recoveries, and forced one fumble.

James Washington,"Coming from a smaller high school in Texas, Washington attended many football camps during the summer to be noticed. Oklahoma State's interest has paid off, as Washington has been an All-Conference performer (second team in 2015, first team in 2016) for the Cowboys. An all-around athlete who played tennis and won the triple jump and 100 meters in state track as a senior, he wasted no time getting on the field as a true freshman (five starts, 27 receptions, 456 yards, six touchdowns). Washington stepped it up in 2015, leading the FBS with four touchdowns of 70-plus yards and winning the team's Thurman Thomas Most Valuable Offensive Player award (53 receptions, 1,087 yards, 10 touchdowns). He and quarterback Mason Rudolph continued to terrorize defenses in 2016, connecting 71 times for 1,380 yards and nine touchdowns. Washington was a first-team All-Big 12 pick after ranking 11th in receiving yards and yards per reception (19.4), speeding past defenders and showing off excellent body control on the sideline to grab Rudolph's downfield throws. He terrorized defenses again as a senior, being named to multiple All-American teams, a finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, and first-team All-Conference. Washington finished among the nation's leaders in receiving yards (1,549), averaging 20.9 yards on his 74 reception (tops nationally among wideouts with 50 or more receptions) and scored 13 times.",6.2,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-washington/32005741-5339-8381-df30-c40eef116ddf
Armani Watts,"Watts is a four-year starter for the Aggies, living up to the four-star recruiting status that accompanied him to A&M (he had nine interceptions as a high school senior to earn first-team Class 4A All-State notice in Forney, Texas). He led the team with three interceptions as a true freshman free safety in 2014, recording 59 tackles, two for loss, and nine pass breakups. Watts put up 126 tackles in 13 starts in his second year on the team, six of them going for losses, and he intercepted one pass while breaking up two others. Watts' junior campaign was cut short by a leg injury, but he still made 56 tackles, six for loss, two interceptions and two forced fumbles in nine starts.

Kyzir was an excellent defender for Lackawanna, earning third-team all-conference honors as a freshman and JUCO All-American accolades in 2015 (37 tackles, three interceptions, four pass breakups in 10 games). The top 20 overall junior college prospect stepped into a starting role with the Mountaineers in 2016, playing the Spur hybrid safety/linebacker spot, compiling 58 tackles, seven for loss, three sacks, five pass break-ups, and two forced fumbles.

Marcus Allen,"While Allen's name reminds NFL fans of a former Hall of Famer who played for the Raiders and Chiefs, the Maryland native and top 30 safety prospect is actually the godson of another Hall of Fame back -- Curtis Martin. Allen made his own name as a true freshman, playing in all 13 contests and starting the final seven (58 tackles, two for loss, sack, three pass break-ups). He was voted an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick the following year, starting 12 games and racking up 81 tackles (five for loss, one sack, two forced fumbles). Allen was a third-team all-conference selection by coaches in 2016, as they saw his constant presence around the ball -- typically in a hitting mode. He led the Nittany Lions with 110 tackles (six for losses) in 14 starts, also recording three pass break-ups, a forced fumble, and a blocked kick.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-allen/3200414c-4c59-6350-251b-fe96500f294e
Dorance Armstrong,"Armstrong figured he would have a chance to play right away at Kansas, unlike some of the other schools that showed interest in the three-star prospect from Houston. He was right, as he suited up for all 12 games in 2015, starting the final five (23 tackles, five for loss, four pass breakups); Armstrong had two of his 3.5 sacks against Oklahoma in his first start. He broke out as a sophomore, garnering first-team All-Big 12 honors by racking up 10 sacks (56 tackles, 20 for loss, three forced fumbles) using his hustle, long arms, speed, and ability to bend around the edge. Armstrong\x92s behind-the-line production dropped in 2017 (nine tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks), but he still earned second-team all-conference honors by playing a well-rounded game (63 tackles, four pass breakups, three forced fumbles).",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dorance-armstrong/32004152-4d21-8905-faaa-3f4d94307d60
Marcell Ateman,"Ateman (pronounced EIGHT-man) was an up-and-comer for 2016, coming off a junior season where he was a full-time starter for the first time (12 starts in 13 games played), catching 45 passes for 766 yards and five scores. He missed the entire 2016 season, however, due to a preseason foot injury that required surgery. Ateman made up for lost time in 2017, starting 11 of 13 games played. Using his size and strong hands, he earned second-team All-Big 12 honors after catching 59 passes for 1,156 yards and eight touchdowns. Ateman contributed in his first two seasons at OSU after being ranked a four-star recruit from Wylie East High School near Dallas. He caught 22 passes for 276 yards as a reserve in 2013 and then started seven of 12 games played in 2014, bringing in 20 passes for 268 yards.

Andrew Brown,"Brown won the prestigious Gatorade National Player of the Year award after his senior year at Oscar Smith High School in Chesapeake, Virginia. The top ten overall recruit and Parade All-American did not make a big splash early in his Cavs career, however. He played in just six games as a true freshman (four tackles, 0.5 for loss) and 10 contests (one start) the following year, making a total of six stops, 2.5 for loss, and a sack. Finally, Brown earned a starting role in the 2016 season, 10 times in 12 games played). Playing hand-down on the strong side and occasionally as a stand-up rusher inside, he used his length and explosiveness to lead Virginia with 13 tackles for loss (38 total tackles) and bringing down opposing quarterbacks six times. He played well again in 2017, starting all 13 games up front, making 46 stops, 10.5 for loss, with 3.5 sacks.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-brown/32004252-4f25-5526-a6f7-6b60c9d607e4
Antonio Callaway,"Callaway was an All-State receiver in Florida, helping powerhouse program Miami Booker T. Washington to a state title as a senior, before agreeing to stay in-state to play for the Gators. He earned Freshman All-American nods for his punt return (28 att., 435 yards, two TD) and receiving (35 receptions, 678 yards, four TD) skills in 2015, starting 13 games. Calloway started 11 of 12 games as a sophomore, leading the team with 54 catches for 721 yards and three touchdowns, engaging his speed and elusiveness and also showing the ability to stiff-arm defensive backs in the open field. He was also the primary punt returner (26 att., 218 yards) and returned an onside kick 44 yards for a score. Calloway has had issues off the field, though. He faced a sexual assault trial between his freshman and sophomore year but was cleared of those charges before the 2016 season by admitting during the hearing he was ""so stoned"" he did not want to have sex with anyone. He was also cited for marijuana possession in May 2017 as a passenger in a car stopped because the driver wasn't wearing his seat belt; he pled no contest to possession of paraphernalia in July 2017. Calloway never played in 2017 because of his involvement in a credit card fraud scheme with other teammates. Instead of looking for reinstatement or a transfer, he decided to declare for the 2018 NFL Draft.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antonio-callaway/32004341-4c61-2552-abe1-70ec5629d91c
Alex Cappa,"Humboldt State has not had a player drafted by the National Football League since 1991, but Cappa's length and athleticism make it likely he will stop that streak. He won the Great Northwest Athletic Conferences' Offensive Lineman of the Year (as well as being unanimous first-team All-Conference) in all four of his seasons on the field for the Lumberjacks. Cappa only played one season on the offensive line in high school, and then redshirted his first season at Humboldt in 2013 to continue learning the position. He started all 10 games in 2014, all 12 games in 2015, all 11 games in 2016, and all 10 games in 2017. Cappa was a second-team Division II Conference Commissioner's All-American in 2016, and was named a first-team Division II All-American by the Associated Press as a senior.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-cappa/32004341-5037-0596-30b8-a29641c28ea6
Geron Christian,"Christian focused on basketball in high school (he attended three of them) except for his freshman and junior years, where he flashed potential on the gridiron. He decommitted from Miami to head to Louisville, where his brother, Gerald, was a tight end in 2013-2014. In his first season with the Cardinals, Christian started every game at left tackle, receiving honorable mention All-ACC recognition. He followed that effort with a third-team All-ACC season at left tackle as a sophomore, where he started to get stronger in order to use the excellent length and athleticism that helped him as a basketball player. Christian started all 13 games at left tackle in 2017, receiving honorable mention all-conference notice from ACC coaches.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/geron-christian/32004348-5235-6698-8b0b-47156534c1e8
Mason Cole,"Cole was the first true freshman in history to start the season opener on a Michigan offensive line when he lined up at left tackle against Appalachian State in 2014. He started every game that season and all 13 games the next year at the left tackle spot, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten notice in Year 2. When Graham Glasgow left for the NFL, Cole moved inside to center, utilizing his strong anchor and mobility to effectively cut off interior rushers and push the pile in the running game. He played all 13 games at his new spot and garnering second-team all-conference recognition from league coaches and media. Cole moved back to left tackle for 2017, again receiving a second-team All-Big Ten nod after starting all 13 games.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mason-cole/3200434f-4c15-1246-1bd3-59946ef2215c
Tyler Conklin,"It seems that every year more former basketball players are moving to the gridiron. Conklin signed with Northwood University in Michigan to play hoops but after playing sparingly for one season decided to transfer somewhere to play football. After one season on the scout team adding weight, he played in 13 games as a reserve, catching six passes for 95 yards. Conklin earned the starting job in 11 of 13 games as a junior, using his athleticism and soft hands to become a top short-yardage and red zone target for the Chippewas with 42 receptions for 560 yards and six scores. His production was down slightly in 2017, but the team captain still proved athletic enough to earn a third-team All-MAC selection after grabbing 35 passes for 504 yards and five touchdowns.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-conklin/3200434f-4e18-5250-1988-fe7b6c249df3
Keke Coutee,"Key'vantanie Coutee, who goes by his nickname ""Keke,"" hopes to be the next Texas Tech receiver to make an impact in the NFL, following in the footsteps of Michael Crabtree and Wes Welker. He earned second-team All-Big 12 honors in 2017, ranking fourth in the FBS with 1,429 receiving yards on 93 catches (ranked sixth in FBS) with 10 touchdowns. He finished his career with an 11-reception, 187-yard, one-score effort against South Florida in the Birmingham Bowl. Coutee (pronounced cue-TEE) showed some versatility by returning 10 kickoffs for 315 yards, including a 92-yard touchdown. As a sophomore, he showed great promise, starting two of 12 games played and covering 890 yards and scoring seven touchdowns on 55 receptions. Coutee earned honorable mention all-conference recognition with that production. The four-star recruit from Lufkin, Texas stayed in-state to play ball in the Red Raiders' wide-open offense. His choice was rewarded as he played in all 13 games, starting two, posting 11 receptions for 105 yards.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keke-coutee/3200434f-5575-1041-42e7-23072fa2ee4f
Jamil Demby,"An All-South Jersey selection and summa cum laude graduate, Demby slipped through the recruiting ranks a bit to wind up at Maine. He started 10 games at left tackle as a true freshman, then did so again in 2015. He missed the 2016 season opener with a strained PCL but returned to play in 10 games, starting nine at his left tackle spot. In his final season, Demby was a preseason CAA All-Conference selection and a third-team FCS All-American before going on to play in all 10 of the team's games. Demby isn't an elite athlete, but his intelligence and ability to punch, move his feet, and anchor in pass protection make him an intriguing prospect.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamil-demby/32004445-4d29-4265-5439-55e6f5234b45
Terrell Edmunds,"FeDerius Terrell Edmunds is not as tall or strong as his brother, Tremaine, but this Hokie is a force to be reckoned with in the secondary. The son of former Pro Bowl tight end Ferrell Edmunds proved his own acumen as an all-state running back in Virginia (1,753 rushing yards, 25 touchdowns as a senior). Most recruiting services listed him as a cornerback, however, so the Hokies played him on the scout team at that position in 2014. Edmunds moved to Rover the next season, starting eight of 13 games played and posting 34 tackles, 1.5 for loss. He broke out as an honorable mention All-ACC selection in 2016, starting 13 of 14 games played and recording 89 tackles, 2.5 for loss, and four interceptions (one coming against Arkansas in the Belk Bowl). With an eye towards his future, Edmunds wisely shut down his junior season after 10 starts to have surgery on his left shoulder. He still garnered third-team All-ACC recognition while playing through the pain early in the year, making 59 stops, 2.5 for loss, intercepting two passes, and breaking up four others.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terrell-edmunds/32004544-4d48-4848-6660-10d05f8639f0
Luke Falk,"Falk transferred from Logan, Utah to Westlake, California to play at famed Christian Oaks High School. He didn't quite fit in, however, so he moved back to Logan and had a first-team All-State senior season. He redshirted in his first year in Pullman as a walk-on, but got on the field in 2014, playing in six games and starting three (64.2 percent completion, 1,859 yards, 13 touchdowns, seven interceptions). Falk ran Mike Leach's system to a tee in 2015, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors after ranking second in FBS by completing 69.4 percent of his passes for a nation-leading 380.5 yards a game (38 touchdowns, eight interceptions). The three-time finalist (and 2017 winner) for the Brandon Burlsworth Trophy award as the nation's top former walk-on played well again in a second-team All-Conference 2016 season (343.7 yards/game--ranked fourth in the country, 70.0 completion percentage-second, 38 touchdowns, 11 interceptions). Falk's accuracy, mobility within the pocket, and smart decisions make him a finalist for the Manning and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards. Falk's senior season did not quite go as planned, as he was benched at times and only managed to receive honorable mention All-Conference honors. He still completed 66.9 percent of his passes (357 completions, 534 attempts) for 3,593 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions in 13 starts.

Dimitri Flowers,"Flowers, the son of former NFL pass rusher and first-round pick Erik Flowers, had been a solid fullback for the Sooners for most of his first three years. For one weekend in 2016, however, he was the team's top tailback. Flowers had 22 carries for 115 yards against Iowa State, one of the highlights of a second-team All-Big 12 season where he started 10 of 13 games played and caught 11 passes for 200 yards and four touchdowns. Flowers was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick as a sophomore, playing in 13 games and starting four (eight receptions, 130 yards, four touchdowns). He played in all 13 games, starting five, as a true freshman and nine receptions for 92 yards. Flowers really impressed with his athleticism and toughness as a receiver and rusher in 2017, garnering first-team all-conference notice with 26 receptions for 464 yards and five scores, as well as four goal-line touchdown runs.

Royce Freeman,"Over the past decade, the Ducks have had a string of dynamic offensive playmakers. Freeman's next on that list. An All-State back out of California (2,824 rush yards, 41 scores), the thickly-built alpha back stepped up to start 11 games as a true freshman. He was named the Pac-12 Offensive Rookie of the Year and a Freshman All-American with 1,365 yards and 18 touchdowns on the ground (16 receptions, 158 yards, one touchdown). Freeman redoubled his efforts as a sophomore, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors (1,836 rush yards, 17 scores; 26 receptions, 348 yards, two touchdowns). But just as Oregon fell flat in 2016 with a 4-8 record, Freeman struggled throughout the season.

Davontae Harris,"During a football game in his senior year of high school at Wichita South, Harris suffered torn small and large intestines after taking a cleat to his stomach on a tackle. He survived that injury, while also moving in with his cousins to have a better life than what was available to him at home. He excelled at track, as well as football in high school, but teams backed away after his serious injury. Illinois State stayed with him, though, and after a redshirt season, he's played well. In 2014, he played in 14 games as a reserve (14 tackles). Then the starter's job came in his sophomore season, lining up for all 13 games while being credited with 78 tackles, and a team-leading 10 pass breakups. Harris, an aware corner effective in press and with good ball skills, was a first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference selection in 2016. He started 11 of 12 games and leading the conference with 15 passes defended (two interceptions, 13 breakups) to go along with 55 tackles, 5.5 for loss.

Marquis Haynes,"In April 2017, Haynes was named Ole Miss' Chucky Mullins Award winner as a defender that embodies the late defensive back's spirit and courage. Mullins was paralyzed while making a tackle in a 1989 game, and passed way two years later at the age of 21. Haynes wore Mullins' number 38 jersey this season, finishing as a second-team All-SEC selection with 45 tackles, 11 for loss, 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Many thought he would be in the NFL after the 2016 season when he led the Rebels with 11 tackles for loss among 53 total stops, seven sacks, three forced fumbles, three passes defended, and eight quarterback pressures. The tall, lean edge rusher with natural bend and hustle was a second-team All-SEC honoree as a sophomore, racking up 43 tackles, 16.5 for loss, 10 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Among Haynes' better performances that season was his four tackles, 2.5 for loss, and half-sack in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma State. The Jacksonville native was a Freshman All-American and SEC All-Freshman pick after starting four of 13 games played, posting 31 tackles, nine for loss, 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles.

The top 20 tight end recruit out of Georgia actually started 12 of 13 games for Miami as a junior, catching 28 passes for 334 yards and two touchdowns on the year (3 receptions, 38 yards against Virginia in the team's Russell Athletic Bowl win). Herndon started 11 games his senior season (40 receptions, 477 yards, four TD), but a knee injury ended the year prematurely. The tall receiver with good quickness for his size (and willingness to block) started three times in 13 games played as a sophomore, grabbing 18 throws for 237 yards.

Hill shared the Wolfpack's award for most outstanding defensive lineman in 2015, posting 51 stops, 11 for loss, and 3.5 sacks while starting all 13 games on the year. Once again a year-long starter in 2016, Hill's production dropped a bit to 39 tackles, 2.5 for loss, one sack, and three pass break-ups.

He started the first nine games of his junior season, intercepting two passes and returning both for touchdowns. Hill also broke up six passes and posted 51 tackles in a season that would have been acknowledged as all-conference team-worthy without the suspension. Hill was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick in 2015 (49 tackles, one for loss, one interception that was returned for a score), but played in only five games, starting three, during a difficult 2016 season (21 tackles, one pass breakup). Expectations were high for the tall, lean, and athletic Hill coming out of high school as an All-American.

John Kelly,"One of the top high school running backs in the state of Michigan in 2014, Kelly took his game to the SEC instead of signing with Big Ten schools. The three-star recruit and all-state pick played in 10 games as a true freshman, rushing for 166 yards and a touchdown on 40 carries. In 2016, Kelly only started one of 12 games played as Jalen Hurd, Alvin Kamara, and even quarterback Joshua Dobbs, had more carries. But he finished second to Dobbs with 630 rushing yards and scored five times on just 98 totes. Kelly caught six passes for 51 yards, as well. A national audience saw his breakout performance in 2017, as he had 128 rushing yards and four touchdowns against Georgia Tech in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game. He finished the year with 11 starts, leading the Vols with 831 yards and nine touchdowns and 189 carries. He was also used more regularly in the passing game, catching 37 passes for 299 yards.

Arden Key,"An Atlanta, Georgia product that was a top 25 recruit nationally (15.5 sacks as a senior), Key is the sort of long, wiry end/linebacker hybrid rusher for which LSU has become well known. He started the final nine games of his true freshman year (playing in 12 contests total), making 41 tackles, 6.5 for loss, five sacks, and a team-high nine quarterback hurries. The promise continued to be fulfilled in his sophomore year when he used his agility, speed, and extreme length to earn second-team All-SEC honors as a full-time starter, racking up 12 sacks and 14.5 tackles for loss among his 56 stops along with three forced fumbles. Key took some time away from the program during the spring of 2017 for personal reasons but returned in the summer. He had shoulder surgery in the offseason, however, which caused him to miss the Tigers' first two games. Key also missed time with a finger injury, which meant he only started eight games on the year. He finished with 33 tackles, 5.5 for loss, four sacks, and a forced fumble.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/arden-key/32004b45-5909-9037-774f-e67d2a30cb11

The two-time All-Maryland pick and Baltimore Sun's Co-Defensive Player of the Year in 2012, Kiser redshirted his first year in Charlottesville. He made 15 tackles in 12 games as a reserve as a freshman, tying for the team lead with nine stops on special teams.

While it's rare to see that type of adjective used in such a context on a media guide, in his case, it's true. His brothers and his mother are also proud of Tyquan for his play on the field, starting with his All-North Carolina high school career. Lewis was on the field regularly as a true freshman during the Buckeyes' national championship season, played in every game and making nine tackles, 2.5 for loss.

Despite struggling with drops throughout his junior season, Moore ran past, bulled through, and jumped over smaller cornerbacks to get onto the national radar with an SEC-leading 1,012 receiving yards on 62 receptions (eight scores for the season). He did not start against South Carolina because of those drops, but got the call for the last three games of the year and exploded (23 catches for 407 yards and two scores). Moore made 29 catches for 350 yards and three touchdowns as a sophomore starter after making just two catches for 33 yards as a redshirt freshman in 2014.

He once again paced the team with 19 special teams stops in 2015, and was credited with 32 total tackles in 15 games as a reserve.

As a senior, Warner started all 13 games, leading the Cougars with 87 tackles, nine for loss, along with one interception and five pass breakups. Warner stepped into the starting role as a sophomore in 12 of 13 games played, making 67 tackles, 11.5 for loss, four sacks, and four fumble recoveries. Warner played as a true freshman, racking up 24 tackles and returning an interception for a pick six despite playing in only 10 games (no starts).",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/fred-warner/32005741-5248-5225-ce4a-b72862edcf69
Mike White,"White thought he might be a professional pitcher early on in high school, as he was named a Louisville Slugger All-American as a junior (9-2, 0.43 ERA). But when he got a chance to start at quarterback for the University School in Fort Lauderdale, he led the team to a state title and was named the Florida Class 3A Player of the Year. White signed with South Florida, and got a chance to play immediately. He suited up in six games (starting five) in 2013, completing 53 percent of his passes (93-of-175) for 1,083 yards, three touchdowns, and nine interceptions. He started again in 2014, but his performance (50.4 completion percentage, 1,639 yards, eight touchdowns, seven interceptions in 10 starts) did not guarantee him a starting job for the following year. After falling behind in the depth chart in spring 2015, White decided to transfer to Western Kentucky. He redshirted in the fall of 2015 as a transfer student, sitting behind star passer Brandon Doughty. White took over the reins in 2016, and was named second-team All-Conference USA and the C-USA Newcomer of the Year after completing 67 percent of his passes (280-of-416) in the Hilltoppers' wide open system. He used that pitcher's arm to throw strikes around the yard for 4,363 yards and 37 touchdowns against a measly seven interceptions. White's numbers were not quite as impressive as a senior (completed 65.7 percent of his 560 throws for 4,177 yards, 26 touchdowns, and eight interceptions), but he played well enough to be named second-team All-Conference by league coaches.",6.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-white/32005748-4936-7864-3ac7-015862958e61

Dejon Allen,"You can't blame Allen for taking his game to beautiful Honolulu despite being a top-40 interior lineman recruit out of Compton, California, in 2013 (who also wrestled and participated in track and baseball in high school). Allen earned the starting right guard spot in the second game of his redshirt freshman campaign. He was the team's best lineman in 2015, starting all 13 games (12 at right guard, one at left guard) before garnering second-team All-Mountain West honors at left tackle (starting all 14 games) for the Rainbow Warriors in 2016.

Kalen Ballage,"Ballage made national headlines in 2016 by tying the FBS record by using his power and speed to score eight touchdowns in one game (seven rushing -- most from the Wildcat formation in the red zone -- and one receiving) in a September match-up against Texas Tech. Ballage did not earn any all-conference efforts because he split carries (126 for 536 yards) with Demario Richard, but he scored 14 rushing touchdowns, provided a safety valve in the receiving game (44 receptions, 469 yards, one touchdown) and returned kicks (18 attempts, 409 yards). Ballage split carries with Richard again in 2017, rushing for 669 yards and six scores on 157 totes (20 receptions, 91 yards; 20 attempts, 437 yards on kick returns). He missed the beginning of his sophomore year with mononucleosis but finished with 653 rushing yards and four scores in 10 games.

Nick Bawden,"Bawden's career with the Aztecs took a left turn early on, but it all turned out for the best. He was a three-star recruit as a quarterback (offered by Harvard, Utah, Washington, among others) when he left northern California (Los Gatos) for SDSU. Bawden got his opportunity to show coaches his skills as a passer in his true freshman season, starting two of five games played. He won one game and lost one, but only completed 13 of 38 passes (34.2 percent) for 147 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. His coaches asked him to move to fullback after the season, and he agreed after some deliberation. Bawden was a reserve in nine games at the position in 2015 before taking on the starting role the next two seasons. In fact, Bawden was the lead blocker for the nation's top rusher in 2016 (Donnel Pumphrey) and 2017 (Rashaad Penny).

His 2017 season, however, puts him squarely in line for a shot in the NFL. He was a third-team All-ACC pick after leading the Canes with 55 catches for 679 yards and nine scores, as well as returning 13 punts for 207 yards. Berrios was a four-star prospect out of Raleigh before arriving at ""The U"" and did start four of 12 games played in his first year (21-232, three TD receiving: 4-20 punt returns). His production dropped in 2015, partially because he missed two-plus games with injury (12 receptions, 86 yards; 11 att., 45 yards on punt returns). Berrios started three of 13 games as a junior (12 receptions, 232 yards, two TD) but became even more of a threat in the punt return game (19 att., 215 yards, one score).",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/braxton-berrios/32004245-5245-6050-b9d8-8b288006bd46

Now Quin's career has reached peaks that his old man's never did, and his size, tackling prowess, and ability to close on the ball in a hurry make his NFL future bright. He was a first-team All-ACC pick and received All-American notice in each of his last two seasons.

Boettger started six games at right tackle in 2015, but missed seven games due to a severe high-ankle sprain; he returned to play some snaps as a reserve in the Rose Bowl.

Kelly played every game as a senior, limiting Bozeman to a reserve role at guard and center, as well as special teams units. Bozeman stepped in for the current Indianapolis Colt admirably in 2016, starting all 15 games. He garnered second-team All-SEC honors in his senior season, starting all 14 games for the national champs.

Burnett broke out in the second half of his sophomore year, starting the final five games as a third receiver, playing fast, being slippery in his routes, and catching any throw in his vicinity. In 13 games, he managed 56 catches for 622 yards and seven scores (also was 3-31 rushing, 4-26 punt returns). His performance in the Rose Bowl really got him on the national radar, winning All-Bowl team honors after making 13 receptions for 164 yards and three touchdowns in the Trojan's victory over Penn State.

Edmonds set an FCS record by averaging 21.1 yards per carry against Lafayette (17-359, four touchdowns). Unfortunately, leg injuries limited Edmonds to seven starts in 2017 (136-577, five touchdowns rushing; 11-129 receiving) and squashed his hopes of setting the all-time FCS rushing record.

Shaquem Griffin,"Shaquem Griffin is not just a great story, he's an excellent football player. He lost his left hand due to a rate prenatal condition, but that did not prevent him from being named the American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year in his first year as a starting outside linebacker in 2016. He led the Knights with 57 solo tackles (had 92 total), 20 tackles for loss, and 11.5 sacks by chasing down plays with speed and wrapping his arms, while also intercepting a pass and breaking up seven others on the year. Griffin was again a first-team all-conference choice in 2017 (74 tackles, 13.5 for loss, team-high seven sacks, one interception, three pass breakups, two forced fumbles). He has played football with his ""older"" brother, Shaquill, since they were young. Shaquill came out of the womb one minute before Shaquem, and also left UCF a year earlier (drafted in the third round by Seattle in 2017) than his brother because he did not redshirt. Shaquem played in one game as a sophomore (against Penn State in Ireland), and then played 12 games on special teams and safety, making nine tackles on the year. Griffin was a second-team All-State pick in Florida as a senior, excelled in 7-on-7 teams growing up, and also could have gone to several schools on a track scholarship.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaquem-griffin/32004752-4929-5884-d1be-ee83dd074980
Taylor Hearn,"Left tackle Mitch Hyatt and right guard Tyrone Crowder received most of the accolades going to the Clemson offensive line the past two seasons. Hearn was no slouch, however, as a powerful blocker playing next to Hyatt. He was one of the top 20 players coming out of South Carolina high school football when the Tigers signed him before the 2014 season. As a redshirt freshman, Hearn suited up for 14 games as a reserve. He was a 15-game starter at left guard for the 2016 national champions, earning ACC Offensive Lineman of the Week for his play in the season opener against Auburn. Hearn earned third-team All-ACC honors as a junior in 2017, starting every game at left guard.

Trayvon Henderson,"Henderson was a second-team All-Northern California selection his senior year at Sacramento's Grant Union High school, drawing the eye of Hawaii's coaches. His contributions to the Rainbow Warriors were immediate, as he led the team with three interceptions as a true freshman (two starts in 11 games, 26 tackles, three pass breakups, two fumble recoveries). Though Henderson missed two games with an injury in 2014, he still posted 63 tackles, three for loss, and two interceptions on the year. He played in two games, starting one, to start the 2015 season (making three tackles), but was lost for the year to a torn ACL suffered against Ohio State. Henderson returned to earn honorable mention All-Mountain West honors as a junior, as well as the team's Defensive MVP award, by starting all 14 games, compiling 90 stops, 10.5 for loss, two sacks, three interceptions (one pick-six against Middle Tennessee State in the Hawaii Bowl), seven pass breakups, and a blocked kick. Conference coaches did not name him to their all-conference squad in 2017, but he was a team leader (55 stops, four for loss, two sacks, one interception, three pass breakups).",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trayvon-henderson/32004845-4e14-3976-d757-5bc16a49692d

After redshirting in 2014, Izzo started 11 of 13 games played the following fall (14 receptions, 210 yards, two touchdowns). Much of his sophomore campaign was spent making room for 2017 NFL Draft pick Dalvin Cook, but he was found 19 times for 227 yards in the passing game, scoring once. The Seminoles' passing game struggled in 2017 after Deondre Francois went down in the opener, so Izzo's statistics were not impressive for 13 starts (20 receptions, 317 yards, three touchdowns). But he had built strength on his tall, lean frame throughout his career in order to play in-line as well as make an impact in the passing game with reliable hands, good agility, and tough running.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-izzo/3200495a-5a48-7369-fa0c-af1d55085961
Richie James,"While James lacks great size, he's an electric athlete and strong-minded runner with the ball. He played quarterback as a high school senior, earning honorable mention Florida all-state honors, but switched back to receiver (49 receptions, 727 yards, seven touchdowns as a high school junior) during his redshirt season in Murfreesboro. James starred in 2015, receiving first-team Freshman All-American and first-team All-Conference USA notice with 108 receptions (ranked third nationally) and 1,346 yards and eight touchdowns (he also had 12 carries, 146 yards and a rushing touchdown). His sophomore season was even better, covering 1,625 yards and scoring 12 times while again garnering first-team all-conference honors (38 carries, 339 yards and four touchdowns rushing). James was also the Hawai'i Bowl MVP despite the Blue Raiders' loss because of his 201 yards of offense (162 receiving, 39 rushing) and 51-yard touchdown. His junior season was cut short in October 2017 because of a broken collarbone (31 receptions, 290 yards, three receiving touchdowns; 10 carries, 57 yards rushing, seven attempts and 37 yards on punt returns), but James still finished as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/richie-james/32004a41-4d47-1122-e8e0-40adb3dc1b8e
Josey Jewell,"Jewell wasn't considered an elite recruit despite earning all-state honors (football and baseball) while growing up on a farm in Decorah, Iowa. The Hawkeyes ignored his average measurable to rip him away from Division III Luther College (located in Decorah). As a redshirt freshman, Jewell played in 11 games, starting the final four of the year (51 tackles, one for loss). He was the team's Most Valuable Player in the 2015 TaxSlayer.com Bowl with 14 tackles. Big Ten coaches and media voted him second-team all-conference in 2015, as he started every game at middle linebacker, leading Iowa with 126 tackles, 7.5 for loss. Jewell intercepted a pass in each of his last three games that year. In his junior year, Jewell was a finalist for the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker as well as the team's MVP and second-team All-Big Ten (team-high 124 tackles, six for loss, two sacks, nine pass break-ups), using his instincts and hustle to consistently find the ball in the run game and pass coverage. Jewell finished his career on a high note, being named first-team AP All-American and first-team All-Big Ten in his senior year (134 tackles, 13.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, two interceptions, 11 pass break-ups, one forced fumble).",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josey-jewell/32004a45-5739-0541-bd5f-e9c6e6d49260
Taron Johnson,"Taron (tear-on) Johnson was not a highly-recruited athlete by FBS schools, even as an All-Metro receiver from Sacramento. Wildcat coaches found out quickly that they had something when they moved him to cornerback for his true freshman season. He played in all 12 games that year, starting five and finishing with 31 tackles, an interception and nine pass breakups. The following year, other Big Sky coaches recognized his skills (44 stops, 11 starts, two interceptions, 12 pass breakups) with honorable mention all-conference notice. Johnson was a second-team All-Big Sky pick as a junior, starting all 12 games, posting 48 tackles, five for loss, and a conference-best 12 pass breakups. The former receiver stepped up his defensive game as a senior, earning first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Sky status by posting 49 tackles, three for loss, two sacks, three interceptions, and a team-high nine pass breakups.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taron-johnson/32004a4f-4867-6640-28d3-66932da34fe2

Hill, and Kentavius Street. He received honorable mention All-ACC recognition as a 13-game starter, making 43 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and three sacks. Jones is a short but active, quick, and strong interior presence with foot quickness that he flashed in 2015 when he started three of 13 games played that year (29 tackles, 6.5 for loss, two sacks.)

Kalambayi did not play in 2013, but took an important role as a pass rusher the following year (32 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 6.5 sacks in 13 games). He was again a key reserve in 2015, compiling 52 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, and three pass breakups.

He's also had issues resulting in multiple suspensions over the past four years, two arrests in 2016 for possession of alcohol and presenting a fake ID at a club. Lasley was also suspended for three games in 2017, breaking up an extremely productive year where he caught 69 passes for 1,264 yards and nine touchdowns in just nine games. He was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 by league coaches after the regular season, following two double-digit catch, 200-yard efforts in rivalry games against USC and California. Lasley started four of 11 games as a sophomore, grabbing 41 passes for 620 yards and five touchdowns, and returned a blocked punt for a score as well.

Allen Lazard,"Notre Dame, Stanford, and others were interested in signing a top 150 prospect in Lazard ¬ñ- but he was a Cyclone at heart. His father, Kevin, was a team captain at ISU in 1993 and his brother, Anthony, also played for the 'Clones. He was the Western Iowa Offensive Player of the Year as a senior (49 receptions, 1,065 yards, 21 touchdowns receiving) and also intercepted five passes on defense. Lazard found a starting spot as a true freshman, beginning 11 of 12 games played and finishing second on the team with 45 catches for 593 yards and three scores. The following year, Big 12 coaches named him second-team all-conference (56 receptions, 808 yards, six touchdowns in 11 starts) and he also averaged 19.5 yards on his 11 punt returns (not enough to qualify for national leaders). Lazard was the team MVP for the second straight year in 2016, as well as a team co-captain and first-team All-Big 12 pick, after catching 69 passes for 1,018 yards and seven scores.

Phillip Lindsay,"Lindsay comes from a football family, the son of a Colorado State fullback and cousin of two former Oklahoma State football players. Two sisters played collegiate athletics, as well. Lindsay's high school career ended on a low note, though, as he tore his ACL and missed most of his senior season. Despite that, he still rushed for 4,587 yards and 44 touchdowns in his career. He was redshirted in 2013, but was healthy enough to be the Offensive Scout Player of the Year. In 12 games as a freshman reserve back, Lindsay was an all-around threat with the ball in his hands (79 attempts for 391 rushing yards; 14 catches for 118 receiving yards, 36 kick returns for 849 yards). The diminutive but tough-to-tackle Lindsay got his chance to start in 2015, beginning six of 13 games played and leading the Buffaloes with 653 yards on 140 carries (six touchdowns). He also contributed as a receiver, catching 26 passes for 211 yards and one score, but received fewer kick return attempts (7 for 154 yards). Lindsay became the main man on Colorado's offense in 2016, taking advantage of his speed, vision, and balance to garner second-team All-Pac-12 honors with 1,252 yards and 16 touchdowns rushing (244 carries) and 53 receptions for 493 yards and another score. Pac-12 coaches gave him honorable mention notice in 2017, despite increasing his rushing yardage (1,474), carries (301), and scoring 14 times on the ground in 12 starts.

He was an honorable mention all-conference pick as a 13-game starter at right tackle as a junior. That was a repeat of the honors he received while starting all 13 games at the right tackle spot the previous year.

In his sophomore campaign, Mahon started 11 of 13 games, four at left guard and seven at right tackle. Despite being at his best as a powerful mauler inside, Mahon took the reins at left tackle for the first six games of the 2016 season, then moved back to the right side for three games when starter Andrew Nelson went out of the line-up.

He redshirted the 2014 season before playing in all 13 games the following year, garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 recognition with a team-leading seven sacks to go along with 32 tackles, 11 for loss. Mata'afa was named second-team all-conference as a sophomore, finishing the year with 47 stops, 13.5 tackles for loss, and a team-high five sacks using a quick first step and possessing more power than his frame would let on.

McCray played in 11 games as a reserve in 2014 (two tackles, one for loss, blocked punt) but missed the entire 2015 season due to shoulder and other injuries.

He tied for the most interceptions at the FBS level in 2016 with eight, which earned him many All-American honors and a spot as a finalist for the Bronko Nagurski Award as the nation's top defender. The first-team All-ACC pick (coaches and media) had just 20 tackles, three for loss on the season but added six pass breakups (a couple of which could have easily added to his interception total). He was a second-team all-conference selection in 2017, starting all 13 games and breaking up 10 passes (no interceptions). As a true freshman in 2015, McFadden made four tackles in seven games as a reserve.

Matt Pryor,"Pryor is great big, long-armed blocker who falls in the category of prospect rather than project. His size and length traits along with his ability to play guard or tackle will offer immediate appeal as a potential third-day selection. He's better suited as a drive blocker who is allowed to work inside a smaller radius, but he's not a bad athlete in general. Pryor has dropped about twenty pounds since the end of the year which could help his case for staying at right tackle, but he's more than capable of playing guard if needed.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-pryor/32005052-5946-0541-f3df-485816e66481

He played in 12 games as a reserve as a true freshman (three tackles, forced fumble). In 2015, coaches put him in the starting lineup for the last four games of the year (26 tackles, three pass breakups in 13 games). Roberts started his junior season on a sour note, being arrested for eluding the police and possession of a firearm without a permit. He was suspended for the opener but started eight of 12 games played over the course of 2016 (57 tackles, 1.5 for loss, two interceptions, two pass breakups). Roberts moved from free to strong safety for the 2017 campaign, starting all 14 games, recording 50 tackles, six for loss, and seven pass breakups.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stephen-roberts/3200524f-4224-0934-4642-d7d0174f51ff
Christian Sam,"Sam was coming off an excellent sophomore year when lining up for the first game of the 2016 season. Unfortunately, a foot injury suffered in that contest shut down his campaign after just one tackle. He rehabbed that injury and returned to garner honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors in 2017, leading the Sun Devils with 127 tackles, 9.5 for loss, three sacks, and two pass breakups. That sophomore season saw Sam compile 98 tackles, 6.5 for loss, an interception, and two pass breakups in 13 starts. Sam started at Allen High School for two straight state titles and was a top-30 linebacker recruit when signing with ASU. He played in 12 games as a reserve, making 16 tackles, one for loss, an interception, and one pass breakup.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-sam/32005341-4d00-0938-8e51-1f2d9f9817d9
Jaylen Samuels,"Some NFL scouts will have a tough time finding a spot for Samuels, as he's not a typical fullback, is shorter than teams like their tight ends to be, and is heavier than most receivers. NC State coaches call him an H-back, but he's really just an offensive weapon. Samuels was a first-team all-conference selection as a senior, ending up the Wolfpack's leading receiver (76 receptions, 597 yards, four TDs) while being a major threat in the red zone (76 receptions, 404 yards, 12 TDs). He was named third-team All-ACC pick in 2016, leading his team with 55 catches (for 565 yards, seven scores) and finishing third on the squad in rushing (33 rush, 189 yards, six TDs). He was named the Offensive MVP in the Independence Bowl win over Vanderbilt (six receptions, 104 yards, three TDs). Samuels started 10 of 13 games played for the second straight year in 2016, one year after winning All-American, first-team All-ACC, and Pack Offensive MVP honors by leading all tight ends nationally in receptions (65 receptions, 597 yards, seven TDs) and running for 368 yards and nine touchdowns on 56 attempts. In limited touches as a freshman, Samuels showed glimpses of his talent (15 rush, 143 yards, TD; six receptions, 96 yards, one TD). This versatility was not a surprise, as Samuels was the top prospect in North Carolina in high school after putting up 2,300 yards of total offense and 55 touchdowns as a senior.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylen-samuels/32005341-4d71-3301-f2ff-d32355fda80f
Zach Sieler,"When teams scout prospects from small schools, they are looking for plus physical and athletic traits and they are looking for them to dominate their level of competition. Sieler whipped the competition in front of him on a regular basis and his traits are right in line with the NFL average for his position. Sieler played 4-3 defensive end and would bump inside as a rusher, but his playing style and size scream old-school, 3-4 defensive end. Sieler needs to prove that his production can translate at a reasonable level as a pro, but he has the size and ability to become a legitimate player in the league.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-sieler/32005349-4541-0345-eb7d-f1c172042af8
Andre Smith,"Coming off an excellent sophomore season, Smith looked to become of the top linebackers in all of college football in 2017. He started the first two games of the year, racking up 21 tackles and an interception, but suffered a season-ending knee injury against Louisville in week two. Despite that, Smith decided he would move on to the next level instead of risking another injury in college. Scouts were impressed with his 2016 play, where he started 12 of 13 games played, compiling 113 tackles, six for loss, and three pass breakups. Smith was a top-20 inside linebacker recruit out of Florida when arriving at UNC, and appeared in all 14 games as a reserve at Sam and Mike (53 tackles, two for loss, one interception, one forced fumble).",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-smith/3200534d-4900-0016-ee20-69fda68dad90
Kentavius Street,"Street's ability to make plays inside or outside has served him well during his time in Raleigh. He was a full-time starter on the Wolfpack's talent-laden front four in 2017, beginning all 13 games, compiling 38 tackles, 6.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks, three pass break-ups, and two fumble recoveries. Street started every game as a junior, too, making 30 stops, nine behind the line with 5.5 sacks on the year, playing with leverage against taller tackles and also able to shed blocks to get to the ball. Street lined up at tackle as a sophomore (moving from end during spring practice), starting 10 of 13 games played, posting 31 tackles, three for loss. He played in 12 games as a reserve in 2014, stopping the ball 23 times during the season. Street was a top 20 defensive end high school recruit nationally after playing two years of high school ball in Georgia and then two years in North Carolina.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kentavius-street/32005354-5230-6064-3bc7-b37603571d6f
Auden Tate,"Even though he separated his shoulder during the 2017 season, Tate still impressed scouts with a strong junior campaign. He started eight of 12 games played, scoring a team-high 10 touchdowns while accumulated 548 yards on 40 receptions. Tate played in 13 games in 2016, starting four and catching 25 passes for 409 yards and six scores. He played in six games as a true freshman in 2015, struggling to make the field due to injury early in the year and failing to make a catch during the season despite being named a four-star recruit and top 25 receiver prospect nationally after excelling in the Tampa area. Tate was named the Seminoles' most improved player on offense in spring 2016 practices, setting up his break-out season.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/auden-tate/32005441-5413-0154-6d9d-5c163b90a894
Akrum Wadley,"This New Jersey native found his groove in 2016, hitting the 1,000-yard mark and earning third-team All-Big Ten accolades from league coaches despite starting just one of 13 games played. He rushed for 1,081 yards and 10 touchdowns on just 168 carries, while also catching 36 passes for 315 yards and three scores. He received a third-team all-conference nod in 2017, starting 12 of 13 games played, covering 1,109 yards and scoring 10 times on 252 carries. He caught 28 passes for 353 yards and three touchdowns. A lean, frenetic runner, Wadley sidesteps defenders and uses his straight-line speed to break off big runs. He played in nine games, with three starts, in 2015 (83 carries, 496 yards, seven touchdowns rushing, six catches, 94 yards, one touchdown receiving) and contributed as a redshirt freshman the year previous (33 rushes, 186 yards, one score rushing).",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/akrum-wadley/32005741-4476-8286-9eed-a754fb579cc5
Tracy Walker III,"Walker has stood out since he was young, partially because he was the only boy among six siblings. As a redshirt freshman in 2014, he earned Freshman All-Sun Belt honors after starting eight-of-13 games played, making 44 tackles, intercepting two passes, and breaking up three other throws. He was a starter as a sophomore (10-of-12 games), as well, compiling 74 stops, five for loss, one interception, and six pass breakups. Walker led the Ragin' Cajuns with three interceptions in 2016, starting 12-of-13 games played, piling up 61 tackles, 2.5 for loss. His senior season was his best, starting 12 games and leading the squad with 97 tackles (3.5 for loss) on his way to third-team All-Sun Belt honors. Walker also led the team with two interceptions and broke up six passes.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tracy-walker-iii/32005741-4c33-5711-fede-9d8511c839b7
Mark Walton,"Walton's father, Mark Walton, Sr., was murdered when he was young. His mother, Kimberly Rogers, passed away in March 2017. The four-star back signed with Miami to stay close to home, as he helped lead Booker T. Washington High to a state title as a senior (1,472 rush yards, 22 touchdowns). Walton led the 'Canes with 10 total touchdowns (nine rushing, one receiving) as a true freshman in 2015, rushing for 461 yards (130 carries), catching 22 passes for 293 yards, and returning 17 kickoffs for 300 yards. He earned the starting tailback job in 2016, garnering third-team All-ACC honors with 1,117 yards and 14 touchdowns on 209 carries, along with 27 receptions for 240 yards and a score. Walton's junior season was shortened by injury, however; he started the first four games of the year before a right ankle injury sidelined him.

Justin Watson,"This Pennsylvania native has become one of the most productive receivers in FCS history, covering over 1,000 yards receiving in each of the last three seasons. Watson was not offered scholarships by major programs (despite finishing in the top five in state history in receiving yards and touchdowns) until he committed to Penn, and he stuck with the Quakers even after ACC and Big Ten schools came calling. As a freshman, Watson contributed heavily in a reserve role (42 catches, 497 yards, two touchdowns in 10 games). He was a first-team All-Ivy League selection in 2015, finishing as runner-up for the conference's Offensive Player of the Year award (74 catches, 1,082 yards, nine touchdowns receiving; 10 carries, 154 yards, one touchdown rushing). Watson's play started to be noticed on a national level in 2016, as he was named a finalist for the Walter Payton Award as the FCS's top player. He set school records with 89 receptions for 1,115 yards while scoring eight times (23 carries, 133 rushing yards). The Quakers also won the Ivy League title for the second time in three years with Watson on the squad. Not surprisingly, Watson excelled as a senior, again becoming a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, as well as a first-team AP FCS All-American and first-team All-Ivy League selection. He caught 81 passes for 1,083 yards and 14 touchdowns in 10 games.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-watson/32005741-5444-1238-2d2d-798b898e0b8e
Toby Weathersby,"LSU seems to gather huge and athletic tackle prospects every year, and Weathersby fits that description to a tee. A four-star prospect and top 10 recruit at the position nationally, he signed on with the Tigers for the 2015 season. Weathersby contributed immediately, playing in all 12 games and started one game at right tackle. Only an injury kept him from starting every game at right tackle in 2016, as he started the first three before being sidelined. He and Maea Teuhema (who later transferred to Southeastern Louisiana and is now in this draft class) split time at right tackle throughout the rest of the season. Weathersby started 11 games at right tackle this fall, missing two mid-season games with what he called ""heat-related headaches.""",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/toby-weathersby/32005745-4140-8703-9494-d754134d28e1
Jordan Whitehead,"Rated as the top recruit in Pennsylvania coming out of high school, Whitehead starred on both the offensive (148 carries 1,933 rushing yards; 24 receptions, 471 yards receiving) and defensive (seven interceptions) sides of the ball. Though he was considered a top-20 cornerback prospect nationally, Pitt coaches put him at safety as a true freshman to utilize his toughness in the run game. The result was a consensus freshman All-American and third-team All-ACC season where he started 12 of 13 games played, leading the Panthers with 109 tackles, six for loss, an interception and six pass breakups. Whitehead was also used on offense (12 carries, 122 yards, two touchdowns rushing). His sophomore season wasn't quite as successful [65 tackles, 1.5 for loss, one interception (returned for a touchdown), two pass breakups] as he started just nine games, missing the final three with a broken arm. Coaches started him at receiver against Virginia but again used him as a running threat on offense (nine carries, 98 yards rushing). Whitehead's junior season began with a three-game suspension for violating team rules. He still garnered honorable mention All-ACC notice while starting nine games, however (60 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups).",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-whitehead/32005748-4962-2731-1d92-ce80d512db34

Williams managed to get 64 carries for 302 yards and three scores in 12 games as a true freshman at LSU (6 receptions, 63 yards receiving) in 2014. The following year he had similar numbers (60 carries, 296 yards, four touchdowns rushing; fur receptions, 31 yards receiving) in 12 games. With Fournette out early in 2016, Williams got two starts but ended up with fewer carries for the year (52 carries, 233 yards, three touchdowns rushing; five receptions, 37 yards receiving) with Guice becoming the workhorse.",5.9,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrel-williams/32005749-4c20-7361-9bac-e63ffb6793a8

He was All-Conference as a freshman there and an All-American as a sophomore with 66 catches for 1,045 yards and 17 touchdowns. Wilson didn't take long to fit in with the Broncos, earning honorable mention All-Mountain West honors as a receiver (56 receptions, 1,129 yards, led team with 11 touchdowns) while also contributing as a punt returner (10 returns, 132 yards, long of 73 yards) in his junior campaign. His senior season was even better, earning first-team All-Conference recognition by leading BSU with 83 receptions and 1,511 yards, scoring seven times.

In 2015, he played three games before a torn ACL ended his year (14 receptions, 152 yards, two TD; six att., 149 yards on kickoff returns; two att., 15 yards on punt returns). While rehabbing his knee, Akins got stronger to move to tight end. The change paid off as he started seven of 13 games played, catching 23 balls for 347 yards and two scores in 2016. He took another step forward in 2017, garnering first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors for starting 12 games and catching 32 passes for 515 yards and four touchdowns for the undefeated Knights.

Facyson also broke his leg in a December practice which required surgery. Somehow, he returned to start 10 of 12 games played in 2015, making 27 tackles, breaking up 10 passes. Facyson seemed healthier in his junior season, using his size and length to play with physicality (48 tackles, four for loss) and consistently knock away passes (11) while starting all 14 games.

Quadree Henderson,"Despite his lack of size, Henderson was the top overall high school recruit in Delaware in 2014 after earning first-team all-state honors as a receiver (36 receptions, 826 yards, 13 TD), defensive back (four interceptions), and returner (two kickoff return scores). He played in nine games for Pitt as a true freshman, returning 18 kicks for 504 yards, including a 100-yard touchdown against Navy in the Military Bowl. Henderson made a name for himself as a returner the following fall, earning consensus All-American honors after leading the FBS with total return yardage (1,166), ranking third with 15.8 yards per punt return (16 attempts, 252 yards, one TD) and fifth in the country with 30.5 yards per kick return (30 attempts, 914 yards, 3 TD). He was also a star on offense as a receiver (26 receptions, 286 yards, one TD) and runner (60 attempts, 631 yards, 10.5 yards per rush, five TD). Henderson's stats retreated a bit in 2017, though he played in all 12 games, starting six. He was a second-team All-ACC pick as a specialist, however, returning two punts for touchdowns (21 attempts, 243 yards) to finish as Pitt's all-time leader with seven return scores. He also returned 25 kickoffs for 524 yards while contributing on offense (17 receptions, 186 yards; 36 attempts, 251 yards rushing).",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quadree-henderson/32004845-4e12-0889-bfba-415a22b13e5b
Steve Ishmael,"Ishmael has the size of an outside receiver and shows enough quickness and route acumen to create opportunities, but his lack of long speed could hurt his case. However, Ishmael's experience in working from the slot might open a door for him as a big slot with the ability to handle work from the perimeter when needed. He's a possession receiver with good hands and underrated short-area quickness who could impress in camp even if he goes undrafted.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/steve-ishmael/32004953-4842-5791-be1f-c097fb1c2b62
Joel Iyiegbuniwe,"Iyiegbuniwe (pronounced ee-yay-boo-nee-way) slipped under the recruiting radar as an injury cut his senior season in high school to just four games. Then, he suffered an injury three games into his true freshman season with the Hilltoppers (he made one tackle), which resulted in his receiving a medical redshirt. The Bowling Green, Kentucky native finally played a full season in 2015, suiting up for 14 games as a reserve linebacker and special teams ace (19 tackles, one sack). That production led to a big sophomore season, as he earned honorable mention All-Conference USA recognition after starting all 14 games (64 stops, 10 for loss, 3.5 sacks, three pass break-ups).  The compactly-built and quick Iyiegbuniwe decided to move on to the NFL after a junior year that saw him garner first-team all-conference accolades, leading WKU with 116 tackles and 11.5 tackles for loss.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joel-iyiegbuniwe/32004959-4917-7981-8e68-457ec1321cb4
Justin Jackson,"One of the most successful high school running backs in Illinois history (6,531 yards, 85 touchdowns), Jackson has also made his way into the record books in his collegiate career. He started five of 12 games as a true freshman, but led the Wildcats in rushing each week, finishing with 1,187 yards and 10 touchdowns on 245 carries (22 catches, 201 yards, one touchdown receiving) to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league coaches. Jackson was a second-team All-Big Ten pick in 2015, racking up 1,418 yards and five scores on 312 carries (ranked third in the FBS), along with 21 catches and 162 yards as a receiver. Jackson's workload abated a bit in 2016, but he still carried the rock 226 times for 1,300 yards and 12 scores -- and caught 33 passes for 210 yards -- in a second-team all-conference junior season by coaches. He topped off the year with a 224-yard, three-score effort against Pitt in the Pinstripe Bowl where he showed off his quickness, vision, and efficient running style. The leading rusher in Northwestern history became the ninth player in NCAA history to have four years with 1,000 yards. He was a second-team All-Big Ten selection with 287 carries for 1,311 yards and 11 touchdowns rushing along with 44 catches for 276 receiving yards.

He played in 12 games as a reserve wideout (no catches) in 2014 before moving to defensive back (14 tackles) and taking over primary kick return duties as a sophomore (20 returns, 448 yards, one touchdown). Coaches gave him an opportunity to show his stuff in 2016, playing him in eight games with two starts at nickel (19 stops, four pass breakups), though he missed six mid-season games with a left leg injury. Jamerson moved to safety for his senior season, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors by posting 51 tackles, 3.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, two interceptions (one returned for a score), and 10 pass breakups.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/natrell-jamerson/32004a41-4d04-2973-6499-345354345440
Michael Joseph,"Joseph was quite literally nobody in recruiting circles, not even being rated because he did not star as a player at Oswego High School in Illinois. He did not play as a true freshman in 2014, but all of a sudden coaches couldn't keep him off the field from then on. Joseph started all 11 games in 2015, earning first-team All-Iowa Conference honors with 42 tackles (two for loss), three interceptions, and four pass breakups. He repeated those accolades as a junior, leading the Spartans with four picks (one returned for a score) to go along with 68 tackles, four for loss, and eight pass breakups. Iowa Conference coaches named him the Defensive Player of the Year, as well as first-team all-conference for the third straight season after a successful senior campaign.

Kam Kelly,"Kelly is making the transition from safety to cornerback for his final year at San Diego State, taking over for Atlanta Falcons' fifth-round pick Damontae Kazee. Kelly made his name as an all-around offensive weapon at Wylie High School in Texas, winning his district's Player of the Year award as a dual-threat quarterback, receiver, and defensive back (seven interceptions). He played in six games as a true freshman as a reserve at the team's ""Warrior"" safety spot, making one tackle before undergoing leg surgery for compartment syndrome and missing the rest of the year. Kelly was the starter at the Warrior spot for 13 games in 2015, compiling 58 tackles, three for loss, two interceptions, and three pass break-ups. He was suspended for the season opener for violating team rules, but ended the season on a good note with nine tackles, one for loss, against Cincinnati in the Hawai'i Bowl. Kelly played in every game as a junior, making 38 tackles and intercepting five passes while breaking up six others. Two of his interceptions came in his only start of the year, in the Las Vegas Bowl against Houston. Kelly's play as a corner in 2017 intrigued scouts even more, as he posted 68 tackles, five for loss, two sacks, three interceptions, eight pass break-ups, and two forced fumbles in a first-team All-American Athletic Conference effort.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kam-kelly/32004b45-4c66-6516-3fa1-29f4d5092de7

Coaches put him on defense there immediately, and he earned all-conference honors at the position with 27 tackles and five pass breakups. His second year with the Red Ravens, King was an honorable mention junior college All-American with 37 tackles, three interceptions, and 10 pass breakups. Ranked a top-10 JUCO recruit, South Carolina came calling. He started 11 of 13 games for the Gamecocks in 2016, recording 56 tackles, three interceptions, and a team-high nine pass breakups. Two of the picks came against Tennessee, helping USC lock down a victory. King started all 13 games in 2017, posting 41 stops, a sack, two interceptions, and a team-high 12 pass breakups.

Kyle Lauletta,"One of the top FCS quarterbacks in the country carries a strong football genetics background. His father, Joe, was a quarterback at Navy in the 1980's, and his older brother, Trey, played center at Bucknell. Lauletta's grandfather played football at Delaware, and his uncle played for Navy. He was a two-time All-Southeastern pick in high school but did not end up at a major program. Lauletta played in four games as a reserve for the Spiders in 2013 and then redshirted the following year.

Jim Looney,"Looney grew up around football, as his father James played linebacker at Louisville and his older brother, Joe, played offensive line at Wake Forest and is now a part-time starter in the NFL (fourth-round pick in 2012 by San Francisco). James began his career at Wake Forest, playing in six games (three tackles, half-sack) as a true freshman in 2013. When head coach Jim Grobe was let go, Looney decided it was best to move on. He chose Cal, as brother Joe was with the Niners at the time (he's now with Dallas) and he liked the Cal coaching staff. In 2015, Looney played in 12 games (starting 11), made 35 tackles, three for loss, and a sack.

He did return, however, to start at left tackle for the Bayou Bengals. Malone is the son of NBA Hall of Famer Karl Malone and was a four-star recruit from Ruston, La. (the senior Malone went to college at Louisiana Tech). As a redshirt freshman in 2014, Malone played in five games as a reserve left tackle. He was the backup left tackle as a sophomore before getting the starting job in 2016 after Jerald Hawkins left for the NFL.

He had been a reserve all but one game the previous three years, recording 18 tackles and 2.5 sacks in 2016 after combining for 18 in 2014 (13, 1.5 for loss) and 2015 (five, 2.5 for loss, sack).",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-martin/32004d41-5263-0923-c34c-27b8599826fa
Quenton Meeks,"Growing up the son of an NFL defensive coach (Ron was in the league from 1991 to 2012, including as defensive coordinator with Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts) means you're going to be prepared. After his career as an all-state two-way player in the San Diego area, Meeks was ready to play for the Cardinal right out of the box. He played in 14 games in 2015, starting eight and led the team with three interceptions (including a 66-yard pick six against Iowa in the Rose Bowl) while also posting 34 tackles and four pass breakups. Meeks got the starting nod as a sophomore (11 games), showing off his excellent length, ball skills, and that football knowledge on his way to garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice by recording 22 tackles, two interceptions, and six pass breakups.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quenton-meeks/32004d45-4556-5345-9de3-ff59a1bfbe44

The Gamecocks captain had just come off a second-team All-SEC junior campaign, putting up 111 tackles, 6.5 for loss, four interceptions, and three forced fumbles. Moore compiled 93 stops as a sophomore, 2.5 for loss, and intercepting three passes. He was the Defensive MVP of the Independence Bowl after racking up 11 tackles in a win over Miami. The Fort Lauderdale High star and four-star prospect took control after showing up on campus, leading USC with 56 tackles, 3.5 for loss, despite starting just four of 13 games played. Moore had four interceptions in that initial season, as well, including two in a Capital One Bowl win over Wisconsin.

Darius Phillips,"Under P.J. Fleck, Western Michigan got some of the better in-state recruits to sign on, like Phillips was out of Detroit's Cass Tech. As a redshirt freshman, he was a receiver (32 receptions, 479 yards, two TD) and third-team All-MAC kick returner (30 att., 792 yards, TD). Coaches switched him to defense before the 2015 season, and he ended up a second-team All-MAC pick. Phillips belied his receiver hands with a tenacity on the edge, racking up 48 tackles, five for loss, with two forced fumbles. Despite lacking great size or strength, he ranked fifth in the country with 21 passes defended, including five interceptions. Phillips also excelled at the corner spot as a junior, intercepting four more passes (three returned for touchdowns) and breaking up 11 others to go with 40 tackles, four for loss. He continued his special teams prowess in 2015 (36 att., 837 yards, TD kick returns) and 2016 (37 att., 833 yards, TD kick returns; 19 att., 223 yards, TD punt returns), using his speed and open-field vision and agility to enhance the Broncos' field position. Phillips got on the national radar with his first-team all-conference play as a defender (40 tackles, five for loss, three interceptions, 10 pass break-ups, two forced fumbles) and return specialist (26.3-yard average, two TD on kick returns; 13-104 on punts) in 2017. Phillips made plays in non-conference games against USC (INT, 100-yard kick return) and Michigan State (INT, three PBU, fumble return for TD) to start the year, catching the eyes of NFL scouts.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darius-phillips/32005048-4914-0202-3000-11de21adea45
Byron Pringle,"As a 24-year-old father of one, Pringle decided it was time to leave Manhattan (Kansas) to go to the NFL. He started his collegiate career at Kansas' Butler Community College, where he was an all-conference performer for the Grizzlies as a sophomore. The former second-team All-State high school player from Florida then arrived at KSU in 2016 and started all 13 games. He was an honorable mention All-Big 12 selection at receiver after leading the team with 631 yards and four scores on 39 catches. Pringle garnered first-team all-conference notice for his return skills, finishing seventh in the FBS with 28.7 yards per kick return (23 returns, 659 yards, one touchdown). Pringle was an honorable mention all-conference pick by coaches for his returning in 2017 (16 returns, 417 yards, 26.1 average, one touchdown), as well.

Trey Quinn,"Quinn was an exceptional high school receiver, catching a state-record 357 passes for a national-best 6,566 and 70 touchdowns during his All-American career at Barbe High in Louisiana. He was also a very good baseball player and a two-time state finalist in the 100-meter dash. Not surprisingly, he signed with LSU, and started seven of 13 games played for the Tigers in 2014 (17 catches, 193 receiving yards; two rushes, 11 yards). Quinn started two of 12 games in 2015, but only caught five passes for 83 yards in the pass-reluctant LSU offense. Having enough of the low impact he was allowed to have in Baton Rouge, Quinn transferred to play in SMU's more wide-open offense. After redshirting the 2016 season, he starred with the Mustangs as a junior, garnering first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors by leading the nation with 114 receptions, gaining 1,236 yards and scoring 13 times. Quinn threw a no-hitter in the opening round of the 2008 Little League World Series for South Lake Charles, who nearly represented the U.S. in the finals.

Scott joined NMSU in 2016, leading the team with five touchdown catches (23 receptions, 283 yards). Scouts got to see his full game in 2017, as did Sun Belt coaches, who voted him first-team all-conference because he accumulated 1,079 yards and nine scores on 76 receptions.

Stinnie's 6-foot-8 frame filled out too much to play hoops, however, and that might lead to an NFL career. He played only two years of football in high school but was a first-team All-Virginia pick on the offensive and defensive lines as a senior. Stinnie redshirted to get stronger, and then played on defense in 2014 (11 tackles, 1.5 sacks). The following spring, he moved to the offensive line in a good career move -- he started all 12 games at left tackle in 2015. As a junior, Stinnie garnered FCS All-American and first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association accolades for his 15 games of work at left tackle for a team that set several team and CAA offensive records.

He started seven of 13 games played, averaging 24.2 yards on his 36 receptions (870 yards), which ranked second in the nation. His 10 touchdowns were third in the conference, as well. His production as a senior dipped as the team's passing game declined, however (41-698, four touchdowns). The Wisconsin high school All-State pick (38-799, touchdown as a senior) and sprint champion (indoor 55-meters, outdoor 100 and 200-meter) redshirted in 2013, but did not catch any passes in 2014 (eight games played) and 2015 (nine games).",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jester-weah/32005745-4101-8734-7070-265da8abb899
Jordan Wilkins,"Wilkins came into his senior season in a foul mood. He missed the entire 2016 season due to an academic suspension, partially due to an administrative foul-up. Then his school imposed a 2017 postseason ban in advance of an NCAA prohibition. Undaunted, Wilkins led the Rebels in rushing as a 12-game starter, covering 1,011 yards and scoring nine times on just 155 carries. He also caught 26 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown. Wilkins' 6.5 yards-per-carry average finished second in the SEC, and he finished the year by racking up 110 yards and two scores against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl win. In 2015, Wilkins started two of 13 games, finishing with 379 yards and four touchdowns on 72 totes (five catches for 75 yards). He had similar success as a redshirt freshman, playing in all 13 games and running 52 times for 361 yards and a score. Wilkins was a four-star recruit from Tennessee before signing with the Rebels as a three-time all-state pick, despite missing a large part of his senior season with a knee injury.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-wilkins/32005749-4c08-8337-ca0c-7bfc2f7b2caa
Javon Wims,"Wims was a high school basketball star in Miami, but tried his hand at football at Belhaven College in 2014. He was coached by Hal Mumme in his one season there, playing in six games before a broken ankle ended his season. Wims left Belhaven at the semester break, working at a clothing store before enrolling at Hinds Community College in 2015, where he finished with 47 catches for 779 yards and nine scores. The top-five JUCO receiver prospect signed with Georgia for 2016, and he contributed immediately, starting three of 13 games played (17 receptions, 190 yards) and catching his first touchdown in the team's bowl game. Wims was one of the biggest draft risers as a senior, leading the Bulldogs with 45 receptions for 720 yards and seven touchdowns in the team's SEC championship season.",5.8,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javon-wims/32005749-4d73-5658-6038-9e0ffd80e896
Trevon Young,"Young has fought through multiple injuries during his college career. He suffered a dislocated and fractured hip in the team's 2015 bowl game, missing the 2016 season. Young returned for the 2017 season opener, however, starting 12 of 13 games played. He finished the year with 62 tackles, 12 for loss, 4.5 sacks, and five pass breakups. Young first held the starting role in 2015, earning honorable mention All-ACC honors (eight starts in 12 games played, 32 tackles, 10 for loss, 8.5 sacks, interception, two forced fumbles). He played 11 games as a reserve in 2014 after transferring from Iowa Western Community College, where he was a second-team All-American in his lone season there (22 tackles for loss, 13.5 sacks).

Josh Adams,"Adams and top offensive tackle prospect Mike McGlinchey are two of the three Pennsylvania natives on the Irish's 2017 roster. Adams was an all-state pick as a senior (1,623 yards, 25 touchdowns, 7.8 yards per carry), coming off a junior year where he was limited by a torn ACL. He was the backup to 2016 third-round pick C.J. Prosise as a true freshman, starting three of 13 games played, covering 835 yards and scoring six times on 117 carries (his 7.1-yard average would have ranked fourth in the country if he had enough carries to qualify). He made a name for himself with a 98-yard run against Wake Forest (longest play from scrimmage in Notre Dame) and 168 yards against Stanford in the rivalry game, scoring on a 62-yard run and setting Notre Dame's freshman single-game rushing record. Adams started nine of 12 games as a sophomore, both sidestepping to find holes and bulling through second-level defenders to lead the Irish with 933 yards (5.9 per attempt) and five scores. He also contributed as a receiver, catching 21 passes for 193 yards and a score. Adams' junior season made him a national name, as he started all 13 games for the Irish, finishing among the nation's leaders with 1,430 yards and scoring nine times on 206 carries (13 receptions, 101 yards).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-adams/32004144-4144-4540-a93e-f3e3911cee48
Ola Adeniyi,"Full name is Olasunkanmi Adeniyi (pronounced OH-la-suhn-KAHN-mee ah-DAY-nee) earned all-conference honors in 2017 as a defensive end/linebacker hybrid pass rusher. The second-team All-MAC selection started all 13 games, posting 66 tackles and leading the team with 20 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks. This success led him to jump to the NFL to aid his family. He started all 12 games as a sophomore (49 tackles, eight for loss, four sacks), his first year as a regular contributor for the Golden Rockets. The Houston native redshirted the 2014 season and played just seven games as a reserve (three tackles) the following year.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ola-adeniyi/32004144-4545-7704-fb69-f33b4d1f1db2
Abdullah Anderson,"After playing three seasons of high school basketball, Anderson joined the football team for his senior year. He was the conference's defensive player of the year in that lone season, but still slipped through the recruiting cracks a bit. The cousin of former Penn State and current Tennessee Titans defensive tackle Austin Johnson signed with Bucknell and he's made the All-Patriot League team every season. Anderson was a second-team pick in 2014, starting 11 games (28 tackles, three for loss) and made the first of three first-team appearances as a sophomore (46 stops, eight for loss, 4.5 sacks). Anderson led the Bison with 13.5 tackles for loss in 2016 (55 total), including 8.5 sacks, while also breaking up five passes and blocking two kicks. He began getting national honors in 2017, receiving second-team FCS All-American notice after recording 42 tackles, nine for loss, and 2.5 sacks as a senior. His first-team All-Patriot League honors allowed him to join 2017 fourth-round pick Julien Davenport as four-time all-conference performers at Bucknell.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/abdullah-anderson/3200414e-4403-6084-a688-4c85df702070
Troy Apke,"Steve Apke was a starting linebacker for Pitt in the 1980s and then suited up for the Steelers as a replacement player during the 1987 season. His son, Troy, took a different path, signing with Penn State as a first-team all-state receiver from Mount Lebanon. He moved to safety for the Nittany Lions, playing in six games as a reserve (two tackles) as a true freshman. Apka started one game in his sophomore and junior seasons, compiling 26 and 28 tackles respectively and intercepting one pass in 2016. He joined fellow senior Marcus Allen as a starter (11 times in 13 games played) during 2017, posting 55 stops, three for losses, an interception and five pass breakups.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/troy-apke/32004150-4b42-8041-da28-445985797da1
John Atkins,"Atkins stepped up his game for the SEC champions in 2017, starting 14 of 15 games played for the Bulldogs in the middle, posting 38 stops, one for loss. The father of one (John Jr.) has contributed as a junior, as well, starting nine times in 13 games (22 tackles, 1.5 for loss, two pass breakups) to free up other defenders to make big plays. Atkins started three of 10 games in 2015 (12 tackles, one for loss) and played 10 games as a reserve in 2014 (nine stops). He couldn't meet the needed ACT score to gain entry to Georgia in 2012, so he spent that fall at Hargrave Military Academy, where he played with former Bulldog and first-round pick Leonard Floyd. Atkins worked as a greeter at a local Toyota dealership throughout his time in Athens.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-atkins/32004154-4b30-9843-b288-6aff44e116b2
Ja'Whaun Bentley,"Thick-framed inside linebacker with a taste for contact. Bentley's physical approach and ability to attack and defeat blockers make him an ideal candidate as a run-down thumper along the inside. However, Bentley has athletic limitations that hinder his effectiveness as an NFL finisher and he's ill-suited to handle coverage duties against the pass. Bentley lacks ideal speed and reaction time, but his size and toughness could make him a solid backup inside linebacker who could find reps down the line.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ja-whaun-bentley/32004245-4e69-6204-7d2a-93eac2a8ed3b
Dylan Cantrell,"Texas Tech's offense has produced some prolific receivers over the past decade, and Cantrell's the next pass-catcher trying to continue that success at the next level. He was a four-star recruit from Whitehouse, Texas, before joining Tech, and receiving playing time right away, playing in 11 games as a back-up and catching nine passes for 70 yards and a score. Cantrell started six games the following year (20 receptions, 312 yards, two touchdowns in 12 games), but then had to redshirt the 2015 season due to a back injury. He missed two games with an injury in 2016, as well, but was still one of the team's top receivers (58 receptions, 675 yards, eight touchdowns in 10 starts). Cantrell received honorable mention All-Big 12 notice from league coaches in 2017, starting all 13 games and catching 71 passes for 816 yards and seven scores.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dylan-cantrell/32004341-4e78-9339-5427-faf42921e1f6
Andre Chachere,"Chachere (pronounced shah-sur-ray), the son of a former Nevada-Reno defensive end and Arena Football League linebacker/fullback (Derrick), stayed relatively close to his Fresno State home for college. The familiarity of northern California helped him contribute on special teams (one tackle) as a true freshman. Chachere became a starter in 10 of 13 games played in his sophomore year, including the final eight contests. He posted 39 tackles, two for loss, on the year and led the Spartans with eight pass breakups in addition to intercepting two passes in the final three games. As a junior, Chachere was voted first-team All-MWC and team MVP as he used his NFL size and closing ability to pick off four passes (117 return yards) and break up 14 others. He ranked fourth in the country with 1.5 passes defensed a game. Opponents did not give Chachere as many opportunities to make plays in 2017, as he only had one interception and five pass breakups on the year to go along with 46 tackles, two for losses, in 11 starts and 13 games played.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-chachere/32004348-4101-4180-3457-54bd5d6a2924
Jordan Chunn,"Chunn, the Alabama Class 4A Back of the Year in 2012, had some success early in his career at Troy. He earned Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Sun Belt honors in 2013, leading all freshman in the country with 14 rushing touchdowns (128 carries, 514 yards; 21 catches for 104 yards). After playing a reserve role again the next year (111 carries, 505 yards, six touchdowns), Chunn was heavier than coaches liked and suffered a hamstring injury in the spring and a broken collarbone in the second game of the 2015 season (seven rushes, 39 yards, one touchdown in two games). He revived his career by rehabbing the injury and then losing weight, taking on the starting role as a junior. The 2016 first-team All-Sun Belt selection (as a running back and all-purpose player) displayed a thick build with some speed, rushing for 1,288 on a school-record 279 carries while also catching 30 passes for 228 yards. Chunn's senior season did not end as he would have liked, missing time due to a leg injury, including the team's New Orleans Bowl victory. He was a second-team all-conference selection, with 774 yards and 10 touchdowns on 154 carries in 10 games, while also making 28 catches for 204 yards.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-chunn/32004348-5513-1923-2901-43823e0a174c
Zachary Crabtree,"OSU coaches mine Texas for talent every year, and Crabtree was among the top tackles in the state in 2013. He redshirted his first year in Stillwater, then earned a starting job at right tackle for eight games (first five, final three), with a midseason leg injury causing him to miss four contests. Crabtree was a full-time starter at right tackle in 2015, earning the team's Vernon Grant Award for outstanding leadership and enthusiasm. The tall, lean blocker's ability to move more effectively than a typical right tackle garnered him second-team All-Big 12 honors as a junior. Crabtree missed a game for the first time in three years in 2017, but started 12 games at right tackle and received first-team All-Big 12 recognition for his ability to protect quarterback Mason Rudolph and block for sophomore Justice Hill.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zachary-crabtree/32004352-4111-6950-707d-976408c218f4
Rashard Fant,"Fant isn't a physically-imposing corner but has made a living knocking away passes during his career as a starter for the Hoosiers. He used his knack for finding the ball in the air while also refusing to give up on a play until the whistle. In 2017, Fant was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection with 24 tackles, 2.5 for loss, an interception and a team-leading seven pass breakups (he also returned two punts for 12 yards). He was a second-team all-conference pick in 2016 after tying for second in the FBS with 17 pass breakups while also intercepting three passes. The former Georgia All-State all-purpose star (614 rush yards, 303 receiving yards, four interceptions, kick and punt returner as a senior) and top 150 national recruit also ranked second in the county with 22 breakups in 2015, intercepting one pass and making 52 tackles (one for loss).

Riley Ferguson,"Ferguson had a chance to be a starter in the SEC, signing with Tennessee after a successful high school career (8,000 passing yards, two state titles). He suffered a broken tibia in his first year, having to redshirt the 2013 season. Ferguson was battling for the job in spring of 2014, but decided to not return to Knoxville the next fall (without letting anyone know of his plans). After working a couple of jobs at home in North Carolina during 2014, he got a second chance to play ball at Coffeyville Community College. Ferguson was an honorable mention All-American in his one season there (2,942 yards, 35 touchdowns, 67.8 completion percentage) before signing with the Tigers. Ferguson led Memphis' offense by completing 63 percent of his 443 throws for 3,698 yards, 32 touchdowns, and just 10 interceptions. His ability to lead a team, move within the pocket, and deliver accurate passes to all parts of the field have scouts intrigued.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/riley-ferguson/32004645-5230-0420-6dc4-385ee7af9cfa
Poona Ford,"Kaylon ""Poona"" Ford (his grandmother called him ""Pooh"" as a child) developed a relationship with former Louisville and Texas head coach Charlie Strong, first agreeing to come to Kentucky to play for Strong, and then changing his commitment to Austin on signing day. Ford was a top 20 defensive tackle recruit from South Carolina that compiled 289 tackles, 72 for loss, and 17 sacks in his last two years of high school. Despite his lack of height, his stout build and great quickness bought him playing time in nine games as a freshman reserve tackle, posting nine tackles, one for loss. Ford started five of 12 games in 2015, recording 39 stops, six for loss, and 2.5 sacks. He garnered honorable mention All-Big 12 honors as a junior, starting all 12 games, posting 54 tackles, 5.5 for loss, and blocked two extra points. Coaches voted Ford first-team all-conference in 2017, as the 13-game starter locked up 34 tackles, eight for losses, with 1.5 sacks. He also blocked a kick despite his stature due to his big push up the middle.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/poona-ford/3200464f-5231-3563-7ceb-0c4e0d3f4032
Matt Gono,"Gono has long arms and possesses the desired physical traits teams covet from small-school, developmental prospects. He overwhelmed inferior competition with his size and talent on the Division III level but will need more coaching and technique work before he is ready to match up against NFL talent. Gono flashes ideal bend and athletic ability on tape but needs more consistent aggression to handle guard responsibilities. Gono could be a late round stash-and-coach project with average upside.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-gono/3200474f-4e20-5666-da7b-e4cdca585c41
Ryan Green,"Green backed up some talented running backs the past four seasons in Tallahassee, but has displayed skills of his own when given the chance. He missed most of his senior season in high school with a shoulder injury but was still a four-star and top-50 overall recruit. Green saw some action as a true freshman on offense (33 carries, 163 yards, one touchdown) and on special teams. He fought injuries the next year, playing in seven games (six carries, 31 yards) as a reserve. Green moved to cornerback in the spring of 2015, but injured his shoulder in preseason practices and missed the entire season. A return to the offensive backfield occurred in 2016 (11 carries, 75 rushing yards, four kickoff returns for 61 yards), backing up Dalvin Cook and Jacques Patrick. He only played in five games as a senior behind Cam Akers and Patrick in 2017, carrying the ball 13 times for 126 yards and three touchdowns.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-green/32004752-4534-8723-17a8-f6890fcfc944
Danny Johnson,"Johnson switched from jersey No. 10 to No. 1 for 2016, and shows the confidence needed to pull it off. Though he lacks great height, that confidence, willingness to hit, and his ball skills have earned him fans in the NFL scouting community. He was a favorite among college football media as well, when he was named a third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-SWAC selection in 2016 after starting 10 of 11 games played and tied for the FCS lead with seven interceptions (to go along with 57 tackles, nine pass break-ups). Johnson made 38 tackles, one for loss, intercepted three passes and broke up seven others in 2015 (two returns, 12 yards on punt returns, seven returns, 153 yards on kick returns), earning second-team All-SWAC honors. He had already stood out as a freshman the previous year, landing his first second-team All-Conference nod by making plays in coverage (40 tackles, three interceptions, 11 pass break-ups) and excelled on special teams (11 returns, 374 yards, one touchdown on kick returns, three returns, 45 yards on punt returns).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/danny-johnson/32004a4f-4816-5289-7eba-eea55c4f9eec
Joshua Kalu,"Kalu has been a presence in Nebraska's defensive backfield since his true freshman season. He was a first-team All-Greater Houston area pick by the Houston Chronicle after his senior year of high school, and didn't disappoint after he stepped foot in Lincoln. He played in all 13 games in 2014, starting two at cornerback (27 tackles, one interception, three pass breakups). Kalu garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades in 2015, starting all 13 games at corner or nickel, making 75 tackles, five for loss, intercepting three passes and breaking up seven others. Kalu once again started every game as a junior, and was credited with 66 stops, an interception, and a team-leading 11 breakups. Nebraska coaches moved him to safety in spring 2017 practices to get their best defenders on the field. Unfortunately, Kalu only started nine games due to a hamstring injury, but posted 47 stops, intercepted two passes, and broke up six others.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joshua-kalu/32004b41-4c71-8106-2624-844a249c6a31

Keizer was a regular contributor as a reserve in 2015 (13 games played, nine catches, 127 yards, two touchdowns) and 2016 (12 games, seven catches, 103 yards). As a redshirt freshman in 2014, the former all-state pick from Michigan played as a reserve tight end and on special teams, but did not catch a pass.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-keizer/32004b45-4976-0006-2355-9d3cc11a56f1
Du'Vonta Lampkin,"Lampkin's size, strength, and inconsistency make him a sink-or-swim prospect who could become a future NFL starter or be out of the league in a year. Lampkin's frame and power give him a shot and could put him on the radar at multiple positions for both 3-4 and 4-3 defenses depending on defensive philosophy. He'll need to improve his hands and the consistency of his initial strike, but he's got undeniable ability to win at the point of attack if he can play with better technique and a better motor.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/du-vonta-lampkin/32004c41-4d76-5431-12fa-3d63a38ea899

In 2016, he played just eight games (two starts) and was credited with 13 tackles and three sacks. Laulile played in 12 games as a sophomore, starting once and posting 26 stops, 5.5 for loss, and three sacks. He was suspended for the season opener that year for being part of an on-field fight after the team's 2014 Miami Beach Bowl loss to Memphis.

Mike Love,"While not the most productive pass rusher in this year's draft class, Love looks the part of an NFL edge player and flashes great ability.  One reason he struggled to make an impact on the field was injuries: he had operations on both knees and a broken right foot during his time with USF. He redshirted his first season due to injury after playing in the opener and suited up for just three games the following season. Love was healthier in 2015, playing in 10 games (10 tackles, 1.5 for loss, sack) and finally broke out as a junior, starting nine of 12 games played (27 tackles, seven for loss, three sacks). He was overshadowed on the Bulls' 2017 defense by defensive tackle Deadrin Senat, linebacker Auggie Sanchez, and cornerback Deatrick Nichols, but opposing ballcarriers knew his No. 98 jersey by the end of the year (28 stops, 11 for loss, 5.5 sacks, three pass breakups).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-love/32004c4f-5616-3741-1e78-8735fb5642ed

He started 11 of 12 games played, lining up at safety and nickel for the Seminoles, making 58 tackles, two for loss, and four pass breakups. Marshall sat the first half of the team's 2017 opener against Alabama because of a targeting call from last year's bowl game. He played in nine games total as a senior, starting seven and missing time due to concussion issues and a hand injury, making 44 tackles, 1.5 for loss. He started the first six games of 2015 at safety and nickel (21 tackles, sack, pass breakup) but a biceps injury sidelined him for the second half of the year.

Deatrick Nichols,"Miami Central star Nichols did not play much as a high school senior, but his play as a junior and track prowess (10.63 100-meters, 22.07 200-meters) still received offers from many top colleges. He went to Tampa to suit up for USF, earning playing time in 12 games, starting once, as a true freshman (eight tackles). His athleticism and toughness served him well as a full-time starter in 2015 (62 tackles, 8.5 for loss, five pass break-ups, and team-high four interceptions and two forced fumbles), as American Athletic Conference coaches voted him first-team all-league and his team called him their most improved player. Nichols was a second-team all-conference selection in 2016, starting all 13 games and pacing the Bulls with four interceptions and seven pass break-ups (going along with 49 tackles, two for loss). AAC coaches voted him second-team all-conference again after his senior season (56 stops, four for loss, three interceptions, team-high 12 pass breakups).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deatrick-nichols/32004e49-4316-3369-c091-2b56b0a54df7
George Odum,"Odum overcame a horrific accident in practice where he accidentally ran into a teammate on a play over the middle, causing the young receiver to have a bronchial asthma attack from which he never would recover. Odum moved on, however, continuing to play the game he loves. Odum started three of 12 games as a redshirt freshman with the Bears, posting 77 tackles, eight for loss, one interception, and three breakups at safety. He played in all 11 games at linebacker as a sophomore, compiling 69 stops, 6.5 for loss, on the year. In 2016, Odum started all 13 games at linebacker and led the team with 86 tackles (7.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks). He also had three pass breakups, two blocked kicks and four forced fumbles that season to earn first-team Al-Southland Conference accolades. Odum played a Rover hybrid position in 2017, receiving first-team Associated Press FCS All-American honors and winning the SLC Defensive Player of the Year award after racking up 120 tackles, eight for loss, and four sacks.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/george-odum/32004f44-5540-1791-6650-dd05691b1af8
Foye Oluokun,"Oluokon garnered second-team All-Ivy League honors his senior year, making 50 tackles, nine for loss, and the first three sacks of his career in 10 games. He started every game as a junior, as well, posting 75 stops, two for loss. His 2015 season was limited to three games (eight tackles) due to injury, so he received a medical redshirt. Oluokun had been an instant contributor for the Bulldogs since arriving from St. Louis. He was a second-team all-conference pick as a true freshman in 2013 (59 tackles, one for loss) and as a sophomore (79 tackles, 1.5 for loss) the following year.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/foye-oluokun/32004f4c-5547-4619-f8c5-4552ff3c79e3
Eddy Pineiro,"Soccer was Pineiro's first love, but eventually, his talent for kicking the ball through the uprights pushed him into national prominence on the football field. He was a four-time All-Dade County pick in soccer and signed with Florida Atlantic on scholarship. But he did join the Miami Sunset Senior High football team in his senior season, handling extra points and kickoffs. Pineiro didn't make grades for FAU, so he instead signed with ASA College in Miami Beach. He only played soccer his one year at ASA but impressed coaches all over with his leg in kicking camps. Initially, he committed to Alabama but changed his mind to stay closer to home in Gainesville. Pineiro made 21 of 24 field goal attempts in his first year with the Gators (3-of-3 on 50-plus yard attempts), as well as all 32 extra point tries. He also forced touchbacks on 48 of 66 kickoffs. Though Pineiro missed two extra points in 2017, he earned third-team AP All-American and second-team All-SEC notice because he converted 17 of 18 field goal tries, including both his 50-yard attempts. Once again, he sent most of his kickoffs in the end zone for touchbacks (39 of 50).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eddy-pineiro/32005049-4e37-5542-2bc1-1264cee3959d
Quentin Poling,"Poling's production, athletic testing and ability to potentially handle some coverage duties could make him a late Day 3 selection. He unleashes his true speed when he's chasing down tackles from behind, but needs to play to that same speed when he's attacking near the line of scrimmage. Poling has some holes in his game, but he has the ability to become a special teams player with backup linebacker potential.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quentin-poling/3200504f-4c10-8494-8602-f856bd9f3f72
Damion Ratley,"Ratley's combination of size, athleticism, and pure speed makes him an intriguing prospect despite the fact that he managed just 47 catches over his three seasons at Texas A&M. While he has bonafide field-stretching speed, he also has the athletic ability and foot quickness to handle underneath routes as well. Ratley is raw and will need to improve his press release and routes, but his explosiveness gives him a shot at making a roster or practice squad as a late rounder or undrafted free agent.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damion-ratley/32005241-5454-7656-a286-344aa8bfd41b
Chandon Sullivan,"Sullivan's success in four years on the field and in the classroom at Georgia State earned him one of the prestigious finalist spots for the William V. Campbell Trophy, otherwise known as the academic Heisman Trophy. The journalism major with a 3.84-grade point average is also the young program's record-holder in interceptions (seven) and pass breakups (18). He was a third-team All-Sun Belt pick in 2017 as a 12-game starter, helping his team achieve the team's first bowl win by posting 46 tackles, intercepting one pass and breaking up five others. Sullivan was an honorable mention all-conference pick as a sophomore (50 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two interceptions, eight pass breakups in 13 starts) and junior (43 stops, three interceptions, four pass breakups in 12 starts). As a true freshman, Sullivan started eight of 12 games played, stopping 43 ballcarriers, intercepting a pass and breaking up another.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chandon-sullivan/32005355-4c12-5724-d256-eb57bc2b276f
Jordan Thomas,"Thomas is a physical specimen that coaches found a way to get onto the field as an outside receiver in 2017 despite his 6-foot-5, 280-pound frame. The team's tight end depth forced the move, and he took advantage by catching 22 passes for 263 yards and three scores. Thomas was a reserve tight end in 2016, grabbing nine throws for 48 yards and a score, in his first year on campus. He was the No. 1 junior college tight end recruit out of East Central (Mississippi) Community College, where he contributed for two seasons (16 catches, 207 yards, three touchdowns in seven games in 2015) after being lightly recruited from Sumrall High School.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-thomas/32005448-4f26-3261-42f2-ffe8415f2381
Roc Thomas,"Thomas was one of the top five running back recruits in the country coming out of Oxford, Ala., in 2014. Auburn snapped up the state's Mr. Football and Gatorade Player of the Year (2,211 rushing yards, 32 touchdowns), and put him to work immediately with two starts in 12 games (43 carries, 214 yards, two touchdowns; six receptions, 27 yards). In 2015, Thomas struggled with some injuries and managed only a bit more work on offense (three starts in 12 games, 43 carries, 261 yards, one touchdown; 11 receptions, 200 yards, one touchdown). Seeing the writing on the wall for a somewhat limited role on offense for the Tigers again in 2016, Thomas transferred in-state to JSU. He only played nine games, starting four, that year but still earned first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference honors with 782 yards and seven scores on 127 carries (16 receptions, 173 yards, one touchdown). Gamecocks coaches made Thomas the lead back in 2017, and he repaid them with 1,065 yards and 13 touchdowns on 178 totes, while also catching 21 passes for 244 yards. He garnered second-team Associated Press All-American status and repeated as a first-team all-conference selection after the regular season.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/roc-thomas/32005448-4f35-3869-a15c-94b3d8db6e53
Matthew Thomas,"Thomas' collegiate journey has not been easy, even though he was a top 15 overall recruit nationally. He was part of Florida State's national championship squad in 2013 but missed most of that freshman year after undergoing shoulder surgery (four tackles, two for loss in four games). Thomas was then suspended for the first six games of the 2014 campaign for violating team rules; he eventually got on the field in eight games, starting three (26 tackles, 2.5 for loss). His mother passed away in January 2015 from lung disease, and that, understandably, affected his school work; he was ruled academically ineligible for the 2015 season. But things turned around when Thomas returned to the field as a redshirt junior in 2016. He started 12 of 13 games played and led the team with 77 tackles, playing fast and strong with the length to wrap up ballcarriers at will. He had 11 tackles for loss, 3.5 of which came in FSU's Orange Bowl win over Michigan (Thomas had 11 total stops in the contest). Thomas led the Seminoles in tackles in 2017 with 85, 10 for loss, two sacks, an interception, two pass break-ups, and a blocked kick in 12 starts (he did not play in the Independence Bowl).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matthew-thomas/32005448-4f30-8770-4386-0de49c98a501
Jalen Tolliver,"Tolliver will step into camp with an NFL body type and the ball skills to compete for a roster spot. Tolliver needs to do a better job of playing faster and playing to his size in order to handle the huge step up in competition across from him. Tolliver's size and ability give him a very good shot of being drafted on Day 3 and making a team, but he needs more polish before he's ready to contribute to a team.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-tolliver/3200544f-4c75-6747-18fa-9fa2c46e6b8e
D'Montre Wade,"Wade is a second-generation college football player. His father, Orlando, played at Mississippi State, and though D'Montre didn't get a chance to play in the SEC, NFL scouts are still intrigued by his potential. He led the Ohio Valley Conference with six interceptions in 2017, ranking second the in FCS with 0.6 interceptions per contest. Wade also had 33 tackles and seven pass breakups in his first-team All-OVC senior season. The four-year starter began his career with a bang as a redshirt freshman, beginning 10 of 11 games played and making 64 tackles, intercepting one pass, and breaking up four others. In 2015, he started nine games (29 tackles, nine pass breakups), but followed that up with a second-team All-OVC junior campaign where he compiled 50 stops and a conference-high 18 passes defended (three interceptions, 15 pass breakups).",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-montre-wade/32005741-4435-0029-4a79-0a608815e58a
Damon Webb,"Webb is the only returning starter in the Ohio State secondary in 2017, with his three teammates all being selected in the first round of the NFL Draft last April. It's not as though he wasn't a ballyhooed recruit himself; Webb was an all-state pick from Michigan that was among the top 50 prospects in the 2014 draft class. Big Ten coaches underestimated his play last fall, only giving him honorable mention notice despite his 61 tackles, two for loss, team-high five interceptions, three pass breakups, and two fumble recoveries. Despite his talent, the Buckeyes' depth in the secondary kept him off the field in his first two years on the team. He played in eight games in the 2014 national title season (three tackles, one pass breakup, forced fumble) and seven games in 2015 (seven tackles) as the team's regular bevy of pro-caliber defensive backs kept him down the depth chart. Webb moved from corner to safety in the spring of 2016, however, opening up a door to a job where he could use his straight-line speed, coverage skills, and physical brand of play. He was voted honorable mention all-conference by Big Ten coaches as a junior, starting all 13 games, recording 57 tackles, two for loss, an interception, and three pass breakups.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damon-webb/32005745-4210-6572-6538-ad457de3e372
Sean Welsh,"Welsh is not physically imposing off the bus, and looks a bit out of place on an Iowa line filled with huge players. But his versatility, toughness, and mobility earned him a starting role since his freshman season. Welsh started all 13 games in 2017, 10 at right guard and three at right tackle, to earn second-team All-Big Ten recognition. He was a second team USA Today All-American and third-team All-Conference honors as a junior, starting 12 games (11 at right guard, one at right tackle). Welsh started every game his sophomore season at left guard (12 games) or right tackle (two), and was voted honorable mention All-Big Ten by league coaches for his efforts. Even as a redshirt freshman Welsh earned honors, as the Big Ten Network's website gave him first-team freshman All-Big Ten accolades after he started nine of the 13 games in which he played (seven at left guard, two at right guard). Welsh worked out at center in the spring of 2016, his likely pro position, but moved back to guard to get the best five guys up front.",5.6,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-welsh/32005745-4c77-3153-2584-d86b09d9e935
Ka'Raun White,"Ka'Raun and his brother, Kyzir, led the Mountaineers to a solid 2017 campaign that could have been even better had quarterback Will Grier stayed healthy. He was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick as a senior, making 61 receptions for 1,004 yards and 12 scores. In 2016, he started 11 games (48 receptions, 583 yards, five TD) and then missed the end of the year with a leg injury. White played in nine games, starting two, as a sophomore (15 receptions, 275 yards). Both Ka'Raun and Kyzir played at Lackawanna College before going to Morgantown, just like their older brother, Kevin, who went on to become a first-round pick for the Chicago Bears in 2015.

Wicker was ready to go in his first year on campus, playing in all 13 games (starting nine), racking up 21 tackles, 7.5 for loss, four sacks, and two forced fumbles to earn Freshman All-American honors. He started all 13 games in 2016 as a sophomore, showing scouts a quickness and a growing build that portends a five-technique role in the NFL and receiving second-team All-Pac-12 recognition after compiling 39 stops, 11 for loss, 2.5 sacks, three passes defended.

Eddy Wilson,"Wilson had a solid junior campaign, contributing in 12 games (starting one), posting 27 tackles, 2.5 for loss, a sack, and two pass breakups. He found himself ineligible for the Boilermakers' bowl game due to academics, however, which likely pushed him to declare for early entry into the NFL. Wilson started eight of 10 games played as a sophomore, playing with a club on his arm for a large share of the year. He compiled 36 stops, six for loss, and 2.5 sacks on the year.

Then, during his sophomore season with the Bruins, he battled through the death of his grandmother and a cancer diagnosis for his father. Now, NFL scouts are giving him high marks for his on-field performance, especially after a first-team All-Pac-12 senior year where he led UCLA with 110 tackles, 8.5 for loss, one sack, and three passes deflected. Young had a strong junior season, as well, and coaches voted him second-team all-conference for his efforts. He started all 12 games in 2016, making 90 tackles, 8.5 for loss, with five sacks, three passes defensed, and three fumble recoveries. The previous year, Young started 12 of 13 games, posting 69 stops, five for loss, and two forced fumbles. He even started six games as a true freshman, playing all 13 contests and recording 35 stops.

He earned the kicking job as a true freshman, connecting on 14-of-18 field goals (0-of-2 from 50-plus yards) and 34-of-38 extra point attempts. ACC coaches named him third-team all-conference in 2015 and 2016, as he excelled in both seasons.

Coleman is a good athlete with impressive footwork and body control to mirror and match short to intermediate routes. He needs to be more diligent in taking on vertical targets as his ball skills with his back to the quarterback are below average. Coleman's 2017 wasn't as good as his 2016, but there is enough athletic ability and cover talent to give him a shot at making a team.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/amari-coleman/3200434f-4c00-0001-5fc7-773e14ca3afe
Anthony Coyle,"Coyle is a Staten Island boy who stayed near home to play in the Bronx. The All-City and All-Staten Island pick as a senior stepped into a major role with the Rams as a true freshman, starting the 10 games (playing all 14) at right tackle. Coyle moved to left tackle the next season, starting all 12 games and garnering second-team All-Patriot League. He received the team's most outstanding lineman award as a junior in 2016, as well as first-team all-conference as an 11-game starter at left tackle. He repeated all of those accolades as a senior, again starting 11 games for Fordham on the blind side.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-coyle/3200434f-5918-3645-bb7c-1cb4999a680a
Korey Cunningham,"Athletic tackle prospect with good foot quickness but a bevy of physical concerns. Cunningham's issues with body control and balance are due, in part, to a lack of functional core strength and additional weight work may not correct it to an acceptable level. Cunningham will need to become stronger and a much more proficient technician in order to hold an NFL roster spot.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/korey-cunningham/32004355-4e52-1305-c38e-0b157117141e
Kendall Donnerson,"Donnerson was a two-time all-state pick in Arkansas before matriculating to Southeast. He played in every game as a true freshman (nine tackles, two for loss, sack) and became a more regular contributor the following season (32 tackles, two forced fumbles). Donnerson became a starter at outside linebacker in 2016 (10 of 11 games played), posting 50 tackles and leading the squad with 13 tackles for loss, four of which were sacks. His senior year was his best, earning first-team All-Ohio Vally Conference honors with 53 stops, 13.5 for loss, six sacks, an interception, three pass breakups, and three forced fumbles.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kendall-donnerson/3200444f-4e62-0788-8890-6c98452dbc5b
Garret Dooley,"Dooley was a star player in Illinois before heading north to play for the Badgers in 2013. The four-star recruit was a top-20 inside linebacker prospect after making 132 tackles, 18 for loss, 14.5 sacks as a junior (while also piling up 1,900 total yards of offense and 37 touchdowns). He could not get on the field early in his Wisconsin career, though, because of the team's depth at the position. Dooley redshirted in 2013, did not play in 2014, and only played in 11 games as a reserve the next year (three tackles). When future fourth-round pick Vince Biegel went down due to injury during the 2016 season, Dooley got his chance. He started two contests that year, played in all 14, and made 40 tackles (6.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks). He became one of the Badgers' defensive leaders after Jack Cichy was ruled out for the 2017 season due to injury.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garret-dooley/3200444f-4f44-8664-ae9e-6067f8f3739c
Aaron Evans,"Evans has grown into a man over the past four years in Orlando, much as the UCF program made a leap into the national consciousness during that time. The Florida native gained 60 pounds since arriving on campus, becoming a sturdy tackle that earned first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors from league coaches in 2017, helping the Golden Knights go from 0-12 to a 12-0 start in three years. Evans was a top-100 guard prospect nationally coming out of high school, but he actually started one game at right tackle, playing in 12, in his redshirt freshman season. He was the only offensive player to start all 12 games in the winless 2015 season, beginning each contest at left tackle. Evans started 12 of 13 games played at left tackle the next season, setting up his excellent senior campaign. His 2017 season ended on a sour note, though, as he was unable to play in the Peach Bowl against Auburn due to injury.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aaron-evans/32004556-4100-4602-2588-b3875390dcf5
Nick Gates,"Gates is a Las Vegas native who picked Nebraska among many FBS programs wishing to secure his services as a four-star recruit from famed Bishop Gorman High School. He started all 10 games he played for the Huskers as a redshirt freshman in 2015, missing three games with a high ankle sprain. Gates then earned honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades for his play as a 13-game starter at left tackle in 2016. He was again an honorable mention all-conference choice after his junior year, starting 12 at the left tackle spot, before deciding to forego his final year of eligibility to go to the NFL.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-gates/32004741-5420-1316-2175-3703fa0c1920
Davon Grayson,"Grayson missed the entire 2016 season due to a back injury, and then fought through back and hip maladies as a senior. In spite of those issues, he started 11 of the team's 12 games this fall and was named an honorable mention All-American Athletic Conference selection with 59 receptions going for 886 yards and six touchdowns (along with six rushes for 40 yards). Grayson started all 12 games as a junior in 2015, catching 33 passes for 448 yards and three scores. The previous year he started 10 of 13 games, grabbing 25 throws for 257 yards. As a true freshman, an injury to his left knee stopped a great campaign where he started six games and made 18 receptions for 176 yards and four scores. The Suffolk, Va., native was an All-Tidewater pick as a high school senior, excelling as a jumper and relay sprinter for the track squad.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davon-grayson/32004752-4182-4232-6169-f7c7194f5194
Shaun Dion Hamilton,"Hamilton combined with Reuben Foster to form one of the best inside linebacker duos in the country in 2016, at least until he tore his right ACL in the SEC Championship Game. In the first 13 games of the year, Hamilton had 64 stops, nine for loss, two sacks, and two interceptions; he was a downhill player and showed the coverage ability NFL teams need today. Hamilton started the first nine games of his senior season before another injury (fractured right kneecap) sidelined him for the rest of the Tide's playoff run (40 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks). He started five times as a sophomore in 2015, playing in every game of the team's national championship run (27 tackles, 1.5 for loss). The Alabama native was a top 10 inside linebacker prospect coming out of high school and played in all 14 games on special teams as a true freshman (three tackles). Hamilton graduated a semester early from high school and was also his class' valedictorian.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaun-dion-hamilton/32004841-4d34-5530-b47f-594299cb7fb9
Bruce Hector,"Hector is an active, athletic tackle who led or tied for the team lead in sacks in each of his last three seasons with the Bulls from his interior line positions. He was a second-team All-American Athletic Conference pick his senior year, posting 38 tackles, 13 for loss, seven sacks, starting 11 of 12 games played. The Tampa native and Class 5A All-State pick as a high school senior started all 13 games as a junior (33, eight for loss, six sacks), one year after racking up five sacks as a 12-game reserve in 2015 (19 tackles, six for loss). In his redshirt freshman season, Hector played in six games with no statistics.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bruce-hector/32004845-4361-1682-597f-7bd1edc0d78a
Zay Henderson,"Henderson was an all-district player from Longview, Texas and a four-star recruit before arriving in College Station a semester early to take part in spring practice. That experience earned him playing time as a true freshman on the Wrecking Crew, lining up for 11 games (one start) and posting 13 tackles. Henderson came off the bench again as a sophomore in 2015, playing 11 games (one start) after being suspended for the first two games of the year for violating athletic department rules. He recorded 28 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and three sacks as an active defender in the rotation. Henderson continued that active play as a junior starter in 2016 (40 tackles, 10 for loss, three sacks) before a foot injury removed him early on from the team's bowl game. Henderson was arrested in December of 2017 for allegedly pointing a rifle at several people and was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and tampering with evidence. The team suspended him indefinitely.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zay-henderson/32004845-4e19-5552-5fc4-af0e9ef329c5
Khalid Hill,"Hill was a blue-chip prospect from Detroit coming out of high school, playing tight end and defensive end. After redshirting in 2013, he played in six games, starting four, in 2014 (four catches, 37 yards).  Hill again contributed as a part-time starter (two in 12 games) as a sophomore, catching four passes for 71 yards. Coaches moved him to fullback for the 2016 season, and his touches greatly increased despite not starting any of the 13 games he played. Hill had 16 receptions for 118 yards and three scores, while also filling a goal-line back role, getting 25 carries for just 39 yards and 10 touchdowns (his 13 scores led the team). He played a smaller role in 2017, starting three of 13 games played, rushing for 34 yards and three scores on 17 carries and catching five passes for 62 yards.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/khalid-hill/32004849-4c47-6723-e300-0baf58bd8a4c
Sam Jones,"Jones decided to leave ASU after his redshirt junior season for the NFL, partially because of the firing of his head coach, Todd Graham. He was coming off an honorable mention All-Pac-12 campaign where he started all 13 games at the left guard position. Jones had started the first seven games of his sophomore season at left guard, as well, but a foot injury sidelined him for the rest of the year. He played in 12 games, starting five (one at left tackle, one at right tackle, three at left guard) in 2015. Jones redshirted his first season with the Sun Devils after signing on as a four-star prospect from the southern Denver metro area.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sam-jones/32004a4f-4e71-6012-a4cb-3c2a2ee409f6
Sebastian Joseph-Day,"Three-year starter with an excellent motor to go along with above average toughness. Joseph's athletic ability and quickness serve him well as a run defender, but he is unlikely to be much of a factor as a pass rusher on the next level. Joseph will need to add mass, but he's got a shot to fit into a rotation as either a three-technique or shade nose in a 4-3 defense.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sebastian-joseph-day/32004a4f-5328-0126-c7d1-ee2dea9d9a91
Keith Kirkwood,"Height, weight, speed prospect who checks all of the character boxes and has intriguing potential that is waiting to be developed. Kirkwood's production isn't anything special and he has work to do with his route-running, but his size and athletic traits and his history of working outside and from the slot will be appealing to matchup-oriented offensive coordinators. Kirkwood appears to be limited in which schemes fit him, but he has a developmental profile that could land him on a practice squad early on.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keith-kirkwood/32004b49-5270-6709-e40c-831dd997b87c
Jordan Mailata,"Mailata was a professional rugby player in Sydney, Australia before coming to the United States in January of this year to try his hand at American football. The 20-year-old Samoan has been training hard to learn how to use his massive but athletic frame (6-foot-8, 345 pounds) as an offensive lineman. His work at IMG Academy in Florida paid off with an excellent pro day (5.12 40-yard-dash, 4.67 short shuttle, 22 bench press reps) attended by all 32 teams, as well as several team visits.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-mailata/32004d41-4930-5232-17b1-66c75ca87b88
Emmanuel Moseley,"Moseley has the borderline size to play outside, but the speed and explosion numbers at his pro day could create an opportunity to hear his name called on Day 3. Moseley's stall in his change of direction may limit his effectiveness if asked to handle bail or even man coverage, but he has enough burst to the ball to keep plays from getting away from him. Moseley has a shot at finding a back-end roster spot if he finds the right scheme fit.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/emmanuel-moseley/32004d4f-5307-0504-6d76-099d35264283
Jeremy Reaves,"Whether you consider his best fit at corner, nickel, or safety, Reaves' true position is ""hitter."" One of the most physical secondary players in the country, he's been a thorn in the side of offenses since making the short drive from Pensacola Catholic High to Mobile to play for the Jaguars. Recruiters had retreated after he injured his back during high school, but he's proven himself as a playmaker. Reaves was a first-team All-Sun Belt pick and the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, leading USA with 104 tackles (seven for loss, 1.5 sacks), three interceptions (he also had eight pass breakups), and three forced fumbles. He was also first-team all-conference as a junior, making 85 stops, 5.5 for loss, three interceptions, seven pass breakups, and two forced fumbles. He was a second-team all-conference selection the previous year, recording 96 tackles, eight for loss as a full-time starter. He also forced three fumbles, intercepted two throws and topped the squad with six pass breakups. Reaves played in all 13 games as a reserve in his true freshman season (16 tackles, pass break-up, forced fumble).",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-reaves/32005245-4166-4151-b77d-42f96e3f4c17
Ja'Von Rolland-Jones,"Rolland-Jones flew under the recruiting radar a bit despite being an honorable mention All-State pick from Mesquite, Texas in 2012. Arkansas State gladly grabbed him up, and he's starred for them at defensive end ever since. He redshirted 2013 with an injury suffered in preseason camp but made a name for himself as a freshman the following year. Rolland-Jones garnered second-team All-Sun Belt notice, mostly due to racking up 12 tackles for loss and eight sacks among his 30 stops, even after missing the final three games of the year with another injury. He started seven games for the second straight year in 2015, earning a first-team all-conference nod with 13 tackles for loss, a Sun Belt-leading nine sacks, and four forced fumbles (tied for ninth in the FBS). Rolland-Jones was voted the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year as a junior, as his 57 tackles included 20.5 for loss (tied for seventh in the country) and 13.5 sacks (fifth). He was the league's top player again in 2017, finishing among the FBS leaders with 19.5 tackles for loss and 13 sacks, while also forcing three fumbles in 12 starts. He overwhelms tackles with leverage and out-hustles everyone to the ball as plays break down, making him a likely candidate to play standing up at the next level.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ja-von-rolland-jones/3200524f-4c38-9788-c5e1-10eb8098a7a8
Bunmi Rotimi,"Bunmi Rotimi (pronounced BOOM-me row-tee-me) did not start playing football until high school and walked on to ODU after no Division I school offered him a scholarship. NFL scouts know his name now, however, as he earned honorable mention All-Conference USA honors the past two seasons. Rotimi missed three games with an injury in 2017, but still managed 29 tackles, seven for loss, 5.5 sacks, and five pass break-ups in nine games (seven starts). He came onto the scene in 2016, starting all 13 games and racking up 43 tackles, nine for loss, seven sacks, and two forced fumbles. Despite his lack of experience, Rotimi played in 12 games with two starts in 2014 (30 tackles, 2.5 for loss, two sacks) and in 12 games with 11 starts in 2015 (36 stops, seven for loss, 4.5 sacks, two pass breakups).

Niles Scott,"Scott started his career at Frostburg as a defensive end, starting six of nine games played as a true freshman in 2014 (20 tackles, 6.5 for loss, four games). He moved to nose guard the following year, starting eight of 10 games at that spot (24 tackles, 2.5 sacks). Scott stepped up his game inside in 2016, starting all 11 games and posting 55 tackles, 17.5 for loss, and nine sacks to earn second-team All-New Jersey Athletic Conference and AFCA second-team Division III All-American accolades. He was an Associated Press first-team Little All-American in 2017, racking up 51 stops, 16.5 for loss, and 10 sacks from his defensive tackle position, helping Frostburg have one of its best seasons in school history.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/niles-scott/32005343-4f52-4870-9577-5e894b7f4d24
Greg Senat,"After two years of playing basketball for the Seahawks, Senat approached the football coaches about joining the team. His height and athleticism led them to accept, potentially as a tight end prospect. But he agreed to play right tackle after coaches saw his ability there. Senat started all 11 games in both 2016 and 2017 at that spot, showing off raw ability that could be harnessed at the next level. He was an occasional starter (22 times in 104 games) in four years on the hoops team at Wagner, averaging about two points and three rebounds per game.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/greg-senat/32005345-4e03-8161-455f-959805637012
Coleman Shelton,"Washington coaches moved Shelton around regularly throughout his first three seasons on the field, playing him at every position on the front line. They found a home at center for the tall, athletic lineman, where he could use his foot quickness, nasty attitude, and intelligence to control each play. He was rated as a top 20 center prospect nationally coming out of Pasadena in 2013, but first got a chance to start at right tackle for seven games as a redshirt freshman. Shelton started all 13 games the next season, the first two at left tackle, the next two at left guard, and the final eight games at right guard. He was named the team's Lineman of the Year for his effort and versatility. Pac-12 coaches thought enough of his play in the pivot over 14 games in 2016 to name him second-team all-conference.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/coleman-shelton/32005348-4541-0481-486a-e4fbdf2ec38e
Ito Smith,"Romarius Ito Smith was Mobile's Offensive Player of the Year as a high school senior, rushing for 1,803 yards and 24 touchdowns, to go along with 27 catches, 383 yards and five touchdowns receiving. Southern Miss coaches didn't take long to plug him into the lineup as he started six of 12 games as a true freshman (136 carries, 536 yards, two touchdowns rushing; eight catches, 76 receiving yards; 10 kick returns, 223 yards), though his four fumbles limited his effectiveness at times. Smith led the team in rushing for the first of three straight seasons in 2015, covering 1,128 yards and scoring 10 times on 171 carries while becoming a major part of the passing game (49 catches, 515 yards, three touchdowns) and returning kicks (11 returns for 233 yards). He started all 13 games as a junior, toting the ball 265 times for 1,459 yards and 17 touchdowns while catching 43 passes for 459 yards and two scores. Conference USA coaches voted him first-team all-conference in 2017 after he started all 13 games, carrying the ball 248 times for 1,415 yards, and 13 touchdowns.

Rod Taylor,"The Rebels managed to keep Taylor in-state in 2014 in spite of his five-star, top 25 overall recruit status as a star lineman from Jackson. He started twice at right guard in 13 games as a true freshman, and repeated that feat in 10 games the following year while missing time with a shoulder injury. An ankle malady limited him to seven starts in nine games in 2016, where he took over for Laremy Tunsil at left tackle despite his short, stout build. Taylor was arrested for suspicion of shoplifting in April 2016, though it was reported he simply forgot about two bags of charcoal at the bottom of his shopping cart. He finally managed to stay healthy throughout the 2017 season, starting every game at right tackle.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rod-taylor/32005441-5965-2290-1c8a-e5feda9d394a
Johnny Townsend,"Even Ohio State and Alabama couldn't pull Townsend, a U.S. Army All-American and first-team all-state selection as a senior, away from his parents' alma mater. In fact, his brother, Tommy, tried making his own way by signing with Tennessee as a specialist, but wound up transferring to UF before the 2016 season. Johnny more than picked up the slack the past two years, finishing his Gators career by winning second-team Associated Press All-American and second-team All-SEC honors as a senior. Townsend finished second in the FBS with a 47.5-yard gross average during the regular season, placing 27 punts inside the 20 with five touchbacks and forcing 13 fair catches. He was a second-team All-SEC pick in 2016, as well, after leading the FBS with a 47.9-yard gross average. He forced 18 fair catches and placed 27 kicks inside the 20-yard line against only seven touchbacks on the year. Townsend was a second-team all-conference pick by league coaches as a sophomore, ranking third in the FBS with a 45.4 gross average (26-of-83 kicks were fair catches, 30 inside the 20, five touchbacks). He kicked in six games as a freshman in 2013 (42.0 average, 6-of-29 punts inside the 20) when veteran Kyle Christy struggled, and then redshirted the 2014 season when Christy righted the ship.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/johnny-townsend/3200544f-5772-6759-e564-04cef442ce50
Andrew Vollert,"Vollert was a first-team All-Northern California pick as a high school senior, so signing with San Jose State seemed a logical choice. He played in the season opener as a true freshman but was injured after a 29-yard reception and lost for the season. In 2014, he started two of 11 games played (22 catches, 335 yards, one touchdown) before deciding to transfer to San Francisco City College for the 2015 season (23 catches, 231 yards, three touchdowns). Without a major program to leap to, Vollert wound up at Weber State to finish his career. That decision ended pretty well for him, as he was a third-team Associated Press All-American in 2016 (team's leading receiver with 62 catches, 840 yards, seven scores) and a second-team selection in 2017 (61 catches, 773 yards, five touchdowns). Vollert was a first-team All-Big Sky Conference choice in both seasons for the Wildcats, and was team captain as a senior.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-vollert/3200564f-4c34-8357-ad18-9cd67fc9a166
Levi Wallace,"In Nick Saban's Alabama football program, the chances of a walk-on earning a starting role are slim. The four- and five-star recruit in the defensive backfield make it even more likely that a cornerback would rise to the top of the depth chart. Wallace did just that, however, after some coaxing from his late father, who passed away in the spring of 2014 from ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). Levi did not see the field in 2014 or 2015, but earned respect -- and a scholarship -- from Saban before the 2016 season. He played in 11 games as a reserve and on special teams that season before taking on the starting role in 2017. Wallace led the Tide with 15 pass breakups, also intercepting three passes while teams tried to stay away from Minkah Fitzpatrick and Anthony Averett. He also had 48 tackles, 4.5 for loss, and two sacks.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/levi-wallace/32005741-4c46-5573-953a-9acfeb7cb853
Chris Warren,"The son of former NFL Pro Bowl running back Chris Warren, Jr. suited up for Texas for three years, but was unhappy about being moved from running back to H-back in 2017. Instead of transferring, he decided to head to the next level. He actually started five of 12 games played in 2017, rushing for 314 yards and six touchdowns on 71 carries. Warren also caught 18 passes for 229 yards and two scores on the year. He started two of four games in 2016 (62 rushes, 366 yards, three touchdowns) before suffering a knee injury that ended his season prematurely. As a true freshman, Warren came on the scene to play in eight games, starting the final two. He got 71 carries behind D'Onta Freeman and Johnathan Gray, rushing for 470 yards and four touchdowns (five catches for 13 yards). As you would expect from a son of a pro running back, Warren was a highly-regarded recruit from Texas that was named first-team All-State after running for 2,329 yards and 34 touchdowns his senior year.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-warren/32005741-5258-2639-cfc4-59a8350f1f7f
David Wells,"Wells was a quarterback in high school until moving to tight end for his senior year (60 catches, 1,188 yards, 10 touchdowns), which caused him to fly under the recruiting radar. He redshirted in 2013, then failed to record a catch while playing in 12 games on special teams the following year. While seeing a bit more time on offense in addition to his special teams duties in 2015, Wells did not receive many opportunities (four catches, 22 yards). His chance came in his junior season and he took advantage, garnering second-team All-Mountain West honors as a solid receiver with enough speed to hurt defenses (25 catches, 294 yards, four touchdowns) and possessing the size and willingness to be a reliable in-line/move blocker. Wells' production dropped significantly in 2017 (9 catches, 133 yards, two touchdowns), but league coaches voted him second-team all-conference again because of his lack of receiving opportunities and his important role as a blocker for the nation's leading rusher, Rashaad Penny.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-wells/32005745-4c36-1048-da90-2f1ae27338bf
Jake Wieneke,"Wieneke (pronounced WIN-ah-key) struggled through injuries his junior year of high school, falling off recruiting radars a bit. Despite finishing his senior year as a finalist for Minnesota's Mr. Football award (68 catches, 1,330 yards, 13 touchdowns), SDSU's scholarship offer was his best, and he's been a shining star ever since. After redshirting in 2013, he was the runner-up for the Jerry Rice Award as the Football Championship Subdivision's top freshman the following year. Wieneke garnered second-team Associated Press All-American status and his first of three first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference nods after catching 73 passes for 1,404 yards and a school-record 16 touchdowns. The tall but agile receiver was a first-team All-American in 2015, setting a conference record with 1,472 receiving yards on 72 receptions, scoring 11 times. He ate up Kansas' secondary for 160 yards and two touches on eight catches in the Jackrabbits' upset. Wieneke was a third-team AP All-American as a junior, accumulating 1,316 yards on 78 grabs while tying his SDSU record 16 scores. Again he came up big against an FBS opponent by catching eight passes and 196 yards and two touchdowns against TCU.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-wieneke/32005749-4542-3136-c9b4-2f12ba00e634
Anthony Winbush,"An undersized defensive end, Winbush's ability to attack the quarterback will gain him looks at outside linebacker at the next level. The first-team All-Mid-American Conference selection tied for fourth nationally with 11.5 sacks and tied for first with five forced fumbles in 2017. Winbush started all 12 games as a senior, tying the school record for career sacks (25) and earning the team's MVP award with 51 tackles, 16.5 for loss. He was a third-team All-MAC pick as a junior, racking up 8.5 sacks among his 10.5 tackles for loss (24 total stops, two forced fumbles). Winbush played as a reserve and on special teams as a redshirt freshman in 2014 (nine tackles) before becoming a hired hand on third down the following season. He led the team with five sacks in 11 games, without a start. The Indianapolis product stayed close to home by going to Ball State, with the Muncie campus only an hour from the school at which Winbush excelled as an all-state pass rusher -- Warren Central High.",5.5,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-winbush/32005749-4e03-2995-df31-e5fc1bc9824f
Jaelon Acklin,"Acklin set school records his senior year with the Leathernecks with 84 catches for 1,369 yards (which ranked second in the FCS) and set conference records with 19 receptions and 343 yards against South Dakota in September. The Associated Press named him a second-team FCS All-American, and he was a first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference selection. Acklin only had 21 catches, however, in his first three years at WIU, which left him considering a transfer closer to home in Liberty, Missouri, where he was an all-state pick with 139 touchdowns in his career and 10,208 total yards on offense and special teams. He caught one reception for four yards as a true freshman, seeing some action as a returner (3-25 on kickoffs, 3-4 on punts). Acklin started six times in 2015 but finished with just 12 receptions for 168 yards and two scores. He then played in 11 games as a junior, finishing with eight catches for 192 yards.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaelon-acklin/32004143-4b52-3986-c2b7-232922b477b9
Austin Allen,"Austin has followed his big brother, Brandon, at quarterback at the high school and college levels, and succeeded in both endeavors. He led Fayetteville High to two state titles (earning Arkansas' Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior) after Brandon left to play for the Razorbacks. (Their father, Bobby, has worked at the University for years.) And after Brandon left the Hogs as a sixth-round pick of Jacksonville, Austin stepped into the starting role in 2016, showing the toughness, athleticism, and ability to handle pressure to earn looks from NFL scouts as a backup despite average measurables. He led the team to a bowl game, completing 61.1 percent of his passes for 3,430 yards, 25 touchdowns against 15 interceptions. Allen's senior year was not as successful. He started eight games, missing four mid-season with a right shoulder injury, and shared time at the end of the year (completed 56.1 percent of passes for 1,427 yards, 10 touchdowns, five interceptions). In his first two years with Arkansas, Allen played in eight games, completing nine of 19 passes for 188 yards, one score and one pick while waiting, once again, for his brother to hand over the keys to the offense.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-allen/3200414c-4c06-1415-1e08-ab527cc03290
Jacob Alsadek,"The San Diego native finished off his Arizona career as a four-year starter for the Wildcats. He earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors from league coaches in 2017, as well as a team captaincy from his teammates after starting all 12 games at right guard. Alsadek started 10 of 11 games played at that spot as a junior, following a 12-game starting role at his position in 2015. Even in his first year on the field in 2014 (he redshirted the previous season), Alsadek garnered Freshman All-American accolades after starting 11 of 12 games played at right guard.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacob-alsadek/3200414c-5301-0774-88c8-293f8f9734b4
Darren Andrews,"Andrews struggled with knee injuries during his career at UCLA but produced enough to gain attention from NFL scouts. He was an all-state pick and track star at Bishop Amat High School in the Los Angeles metro area before signing on with the Bruins. Andrews got on the field as a reserve receiver (four catches, 52 yards) and kick returner (four returns, 81 yards) in eight games as a true freshman, but missed the end of the year after tearing his left meniscus. He suffered another knee injury the following spring and had to redshirt the following season to recover. Healthy for most of 2015, Andrews started seven of 12 games played, grabbing 43 passes for 443 yards and a touchdown. He played all 12 games, with seven starts, in 2016, leading the team with 55 receptions for 709 yards and four scores. Andrews was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 selection after his senior year (60 receptions, 773 yards, 10 touchdowns) but tore his right ACL and meniscus in his ninth start of the year.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darren-andrews/3200414e-4465-2499-1f66-c22a5dd5760b
Jeff Badet,"Given what Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook did in 2016, it's tough to blame Badet (bah-DETT) for leaving his old Kentucky home to play for the Sooners. He didn't reach those heights with the Sooners, though, as he managed 26 catches for 400 yards and three touchdowns (plus 41 rushing yards on six carries, 15 kickoff returns for 313 yards, and two punt returns for five yards) in 14 games for the Big 12 champs. Badet started all 13 games in 2016, leading the team with 670 receiving yards (on just 31 catches, 21.6 yards per catch) and scoring four touchdowns on the year. Badet also averaged 22.9 yards per kick return on 15 attempts. The Orlando native of Haitian descent started 10 of 12 games played as a sophomore, snatching 29 passes for 430 yards and two scores. Badet had a nice true freshman season, compiling 22 receptions for 285 yards and one touchdown as a five-game starter, but could not build on that in 2014 as he was forced to redshirt due to a broken leg and an eye injury.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeff-badet/32004241-4461-3592-dc6b-4a70cf598e0d
J.T. Barrett,"The most impressive number for Joe Thomas Barrett is three: The number of times he was named a team captain for Ohio State. That's the first time it has happened in the school's long history. Barrett only needs six passing or rushing touchdowns in 2017 to break Drew Brees' record of 106 career touchdowns. He actually scored 45 times as a redshirt freshman (he sat out 2013 recovering from a knee injury suffered in high school), which was a Big Ten record. Barrett stepped in for Braxton Miller (lost to injury) to start his first college game and went 11-1 before breaking his ankle against Michigan. He was the Big Ten's Quarterback and Freshman of the Year in 2014, received freshman All-American recognition, and even finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting after putting up 2,834 passing yards and 938 rushing yards. He was also the second-most efficient passer in the country, behind Heisman winner Marcus Mariota (34 touchdowns, 10 interceptions, 64.6 completion percentage). Cardale Jones beat Barrett out for the starting job at the start of the 2015 season, however, as Jones' play taking over for Barrett the previous year led the Buckeyes to a national title. He eventually got back in the starting lineup for five (4-1 record) of the team's final six games (playing in 11 total for the year), completing 63.3 percent of his passes for 992 yards and 11 scores with four interceptions. Barrett also ran for 682 yards and 11 scores on just 115 carries. Barrett earned the starting job back for 2016, leading the team in all 13 games (11-2 record) and again winning the Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award and bringing the Buckeyes back to the College Football Playoffs (despite not going to the Big Ten Championship Game). He threw for 2,428 yards and 24 touchdowns against just five interceptions, completing a career-low 61.8 percent of his passes. Barrett also terrorized defenses by running for 847 yards and nine touchdowns. He won his third Big Ten Quarterback of the Year Award in 2017, starting all 14 games for the Cotton Bowl-winning, 12-2 Buckeyes, completing 64.7 percent of his passes (240-371) for 3,053 yards, 35 touchdowns, and nine interceptions.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/j-t-barrett/32004241-5262-3192-c7c6-04955058dd26
Marcus Baugh,"Like many young Buckeyes, Baugh couldn't get on the field often in his first three years on campus, or get much opportunity to make plays as the highly-recruited, older players rightly saw the ball more often. He redshirted in 2013 and played as a reserve in 2014, playing in 12 games and making one catch for a two-yard touchdown. Baugh was also suspended for two games at the start of 2014 after being charged with underage drinking for a second time in his career (he was suspended for one game in 2013). As a sophomore, he played 13 games, starting two, but only had two catches for 32 yards on the year. The former four-star and top 100 recruit from Riverside, California started showing off his combination of size, agility, and strong hands to connect with quarterback J.T. Barrett in 2016, garnering honorable mention All-Big Ten notice with 24 receptions for 269 yards and two touchdowns. Baugh received the honorable mention all-conference nod as a senior, as well, catching 28 passes for 304 yards and five touchdowns.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-baugh/32004241-5522-7933-4d25-099861ccfd59
Keishawn Bierria,"Bierria knows that nothing comes easy. He lost his father to cancer as a young man (they share a birthday), and recently has had to watch his mother battle leukemia. She's been successful in that fight, and she has watched her son play for the Huskies since his redshirt freshman season. The first-team all-state and all-city pick from the Los Angeles area (Carson) played in every game in 2014, starting four (35 tackles, three for loss, sack). Bierria progressed as a sophomore, started 12 of 13 games played and starring with 15 tackles in the team's final two games (77 total for the year, 7.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks). His missile-like closing speed, aggressive nature (70 stops, five for loss, two forced fumbles), and knack for being around the ball (led the FBS with five fumble recoveries) led Pac-12 coaches to vote him second-team all-conference in 2016.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keishawn-bierria/32004249-4571-6450-a8ad-20cbcdf6d938
Saeed Blacknall,"This New Jersey native was a two-time all-state pick in high school, gaining praise as a top 25 receiver prospect nationally in the 2014 recruiting class. He switched from Rutgers to Penn State late in the process. He had seven starts in nine games played in 2016 and averaged over 23 yards per catch (15 receptions, 347 yards, three touchdowns); his big plays in the Big Ten Championship Game (seven catches, 155 yards, two touchdowns, including a 70-yarder) helped the Nittany Lions beat Wisconsin for the title. Blacknall was suspended for the Rose Bowl for violating team rules, however. In 2017, Blacknall started five of 13 games played, catching just 17 passes for 289 yards and two touchdowns. As a sophomore, Blacknall started three games and played in 13 contests, getting a whopping 31 yards per catch (eight catches, 248 yards, one score) despite the team's inconsistency moving the ball. He received playing time as a true freshman, as well, catching 11 passes for 112 yards and a touchdown (one start, played in all 13 games).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/saeed-blacknall/3200424c-4131-1886-6375-f0b8468fb2ef

He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 selection as a junior, snatching 44 passes for 548 yards and two scores. His one-handed, game-winning touchdown reception against Oregon was the No. 1 play on SportCenter's Top 10 that night. In 2015, Bobo started twice while playing in every game, catching 24 balls for 207 yards. He had similar production in his redshirt freshman season (23 catches, 215 yards, three touchdowns).

Kyle Bosch,"Bosch began his career at Michigan, but that didn't go as planned.  The four-star recruit and two-time All-State player from Illinois played in five games there as a true freshman, starting three at left guard. He didn't play at the end of that year, and then only played a few snaps in the season opener in 2014 before he decided to leave the team. Bosch came back to Ann Arbor after Jim Harbaugh replaced Brady Hoke as head coach, but after meeting with Harbaugh decided to transfer. West Virginia offered him a chance to play, and Bosch did not have to sit out a season. A stout and tough mauler, Bosch started all 13 games at right guard in 2015, then did so again while garnering honorable mention All-Big 12 honors from league coaches as a junior. Bosch started 11 games (five at left guard, six at right guard) in 2017, missing two due to injury.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-bosch/3200424f-5314-9946-54d7-c53676539c3b
Devonte Boyd,"An all-state pick and Las Vegas Review-Journal Male Athlete of the Year from Henderson, Nevada (66 catches, 1,081 yards, 18 receiving touchdowns as a senior; all-league in basketball), Boyd gray-shirted the 2013 season, waiting a semester before enrolling at UNLV. His game didn't suffer from the lack of exposure that first year, however, as he was named the Mountain West Freshman of the Year and a Freshman All-American with 65 receptions for 980 yards and four scores in 13 games (11 starts). Boyd was a second-team all-conference pick in 2014 and 2015, when he started 12 contests and grabbed 54 catches for 904 yards and seven touchdowns. He was not an All-Mountain West selection after his junior year, however, because of a broken left arm suffered in a triple-overtime win over Wyoming. Boyd did nab 45 passes for 746 yards and four touchdowns in 10 starts before the injury occurred. The Rebels' passing game was lacking in 2017, again costing him an all-conference nod, but Boyd made the best of his opportunities. In 12 starts, he managed 34 catches for 612 yards and three scores.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devonte-boyd/3200424f-5910-7085-4ddd-01bd2950af54
Trenton Cannon,"Cannon is not a big back by any means (5-foot-11, 185 pounds), but trying to catch him in the open field is a tough job. He started his career at Shepherd University, but only played in six games as a reserve there in 2014 (47 carries, 216 yards, two touchdowns; three receptions for 28 yards). Cannon transferred to Virginia State for the following year, and led the team in rushing as a 10-game starter (174 carries, 1,178 yards, nine touchdowns; nine catches, 182 yards, two touchdowns). Though he didn't start in 2016, Cannon still earned first-team All-Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association notice with 1,214 yards and 18 touchdowns on 168 carries (18 catches, 203 yards, two touchdowns; 14 kick returns, 449 yards, one touchdown). In his final season, the Hampton native finished third in Division II in rushing with 1,638 yards on 212 totes, scoring 17 times on the ground (21 catches, 225 yards, three touchdowns).

As a freshman, he started all but the opener, making 65 tackles, intercepting one pass (against NFL Hall of Famer Joe Montana's son, Nick) and breaking up eight others. Chandler's sophomore season was no disappointment, as he earned second-team All-AAC honors by starting every game, posting 65 stops (5.5 for loss), intercepting four passes (taking back two for scores) and breaking up 10 others. He also impressed as a punt returner (17 returns, 206 yards). He repeated the second-team all-conference accolades in 2016 (51 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions) despite moving from cornerback to free safety.

Lavon Coleman,"Coleman came from the high school of former Washington standout back Napoleon Kaufman (Lompoc, Calif.) and was a top-25 runner nationally, so expectations for him in Seattle were high despite the fact that he missed most of his senior year with injury. Coleman redshirted in 2013, though he was named Offensive Scout Squad MVP for the mid-week looks he gave the starters. He started two of the 11 games he played in 2014 (missing two with an injury), gaining 565 yards and scoring once on 138 carries (nine receptions, 35 yards). Though Coleman played in all 13 games as a sophomore, he saw the ball less often (33 carries, 176 yards rushing; four receptions, 31 yards receiving) and started just once, in the Heart of Dallas Bowl win over Southern Miss (six carries, 39 yards). The strong one-cut, north-south runner only had 114 carries in 2016, but he scored seven times and set a school record with 7.5 yards per attempt to get to 852 yards for the year (including 101 on 18 carries in Washington's win in the Pac-12 Championship Game).

He suited up at quarterback for the Hoosiers in 2014, but struggled as a passer (3-of-12, 31 yards, no scores, two interceptions) and then suffered a season-ending ACL injury against Iowa. He moved to linebacker during the following spring, and played in the team's final eight games there (four tackles). Becoming more comfortable at the position, he started once in 13 games played, making 29 stops, three for loss, and two sacks. Covington took another step forward at linebacker in 2017, using his athleticism to garner honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a 12-game starter, posting 85 tackles, 12 for loss, three sacks, and five pass breakups.

Trevor Daniel,"Daniel grew up in Tennessee playing football, basketball, soccer, and baseball during his high school career. His home-state SEC program didn't offer him a scholarship, but he walked on to the Volunteers, anyway. After a redshirt season in 2013 and a year watching Matt Darr, Daniel finally got his shot. All he did was set a school record for gross punting average (45.7 yards), placing 25 of 60 punts inside the 20 yard-line (against nine touchbacks), and forcing 15 fair catches. While his gross average dropped a bit in 2016 (44.6), Daniel forced fair catches on 29 of 70 punts and put 28 inside the 20 (again with nine touchbacks). He had an excellent season as a senior, as well, finishing in the top five nationally with a 47.5-yard gross average.

The following year, Delaney was a second-team Associated Press All-American with 46 tackles, one for loss, five interceptions (ranking eighth in the FCS), eight pass breakups, and two forced fumbles.

Gus Edwards,"His size and athletic scores will get him into a camp, but he lacks value on third downs and doesn't appear to be a dynamic enough runner to land a roster spot with that talent alone. Instead, Edwards may have to prove himself as a special teams star in order to snare an RB3 or RB4 spot as a pro.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gus-edwards/32004544-5747-1180-daba-c0c892edc0c8
Donnie Ernsberger,"Ernsberger's sister, Shalene, created a viral video in October 2017 by running onto the field to celebrate a touchdown by her brother. That was one of four scores the thick receiver caught on the year among his 34 receptions that covered 394 yards. The two-time All-MAC selection (second team in 2017, third team in 2016) was more typically used as a strong lead blocker for the Broncos' rushing attack during his career, starting all 39 games from 2015 to 2017, but only catching nine passes for 112 yards and a score in 2016 and two for 22 yards the previous season. In 2014, the Battle Creek, Mich., native was primarily used as a blocking fullback and on special teams.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/donnie-ernsberger/32004552-4e25-2861-b9b5-dec7e862977c
Ajay Fanene,"Fanene was born in Samoa, but came to America when he was six years old and never returned. His aunt and uncle (who he lived with in the States) did not allow him to play football as a youth, due to their beliefs as Seventh-Day Adventists. He played at Riverside Community College for two years, but transferred to a Division II school in Georgia for one year, but did not play. After two years off, he joined the Crusaders. In 2016, he garnered All-American Southwest Conference honors after starting eight of 10 games played, posting 25 tackles, 11.5 for loss, and six sacks. Fanene really came onto the scene in 2017, accumulating 38 stops, 20.5 for loss, 16.5 sacks, seven pass breakups, and four forced fumbles. He was the ASC's Defensive Lineman of the Year and was a first-team all-conference member.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ajay-fanene/32004641-4e06-0096-d920-f1e4df75b928
Sharif Finch,"Finch has the body type and the testing numbers to warrant additional film study, but there may not be enough there on tape to project him as a future edge rusher. Finch's lack of power at the point of attack will hurt his chances to play on early downs and he may not have enough consistency as a pass rusher to make a roster.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sharif-finch/32004649-4e17-0565-4975-94c496a585be
Quinton Flowers,"Flowers' lack of height caused him to be underestimated as a quarterback heading into high school and college. NFL general managers have to decide whether he has the consistent accuracy from the pocket to lead an NFL offense, but his speed and agility with the ball in his hands and his ability as a playmaker are unquestioned. The four-star recruit and All-Dade County pick as a high school senior (6,042 passing yards, 2,002 rushing yards in his career) signed on to USF because they believed in his ability as a passer. He played in five games as a true freshman, starting once (8-20, 111 yards, two interceptions; 13-73 rushing). Flowers then took over the starting role as a sophomore, leading the USF offense to a school record 5,741 yards of total offense and earning the team's MVP award. He completed 163 of 276 throws (59.1 percent) for 2,296 yards, 22 touchdowns, and eight interceptions while rushing for 991 yards and 12 scores on 191 carries. Flowers excelled as a junior, garnering the American Athletic Conference's Offensive Player of the Year award as a first-team All-Conference pick. He set a school record for rushing yards (1,530) and scores (18) while ranking fourth in the country with 7.7 yards per carry. Flowers also completed 62.5 percent of his passes for 2,807 yards and 24 touchdowns against eight picks. He was the Birmingham Bowl MVP, as well, leading the Bulls to a win over South Carolina (105 rushing yards, three rushing scores, 261 passing yards, two passing touchdowns). While he was relegated to second-team All-Conference in 2017, Flowers still led the school to a 10-2 record and a Birmingham Bowl win over Texas Tech. He started all 12 games (53.1 completion percentage, 2,911 yards, 25 touchdowns passing, six interceptions; 1,078 yards, 11 scores rushing). Flowers lost both of his parents as a youth (father to an accidental shooting, mother to cancer), but is now a father to a young daughter. His stepbrother was also shot and killed just days before he started his first game with the Bulls in 2014.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quinton-flowers/3200464c-4f47-1270-1874-de35cf5dd333
Keith Ford,"Ford's career started in Oklahoma, but midway through his five years on campus, it was time for a change. The five-star recruit and top-10 running back prospect nationally joined the Sooners in 2013, getting some carries during his 10 games of action (23 carries, 134 yards, one touchdown). The following year, he started three of eight games played, making an impact as a rusher (63 carries, 369 yards, five touchdowns) and receiver (11 receptions, 140 yards, one touchdown). Ford was suspended during 2015 spring practices, however, for academic and team rules violations. He stated that Sooners running back coach Jay Boulware treated him like he was ""in high school."" A transfer to A&M was in the cards, and he was named the team's Offensive Scout Team MVP while redshirting the fall of 2015. Ford started nine games in his first year of action with the Aggies, playing in all 13 to rush for 669 yards and six scores on 126 carries (five receptions, 81 yards).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keith-ford/3200464f-5226-7420-5f62-06b00b6b5e82
Robert Foster,"Foster looked on his way to becoming an all-conference performer as a redshirt sophomore in 2015, grabbing 10 catches for 116 yards and two scores while starting the Tide's first three games. He dove for a pass in that third game, however, and suffered a season-ending injury to his right shoulder. Foster worked his way back to the field for 2016, but only caught passes in two of the ten games in which he played (five receptions, 55 yards). He considered transferring after the season due to that lack of playing time but chose to return. Foster started 13 of 14 games for the national champs, catching 14 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown for a team that lacked a passing attack. A high school first-team All-American and top-five receiver recruit nationally, Foster played in nine games in 2014 (six receptions, 44 yards) after redshirting his first year in Tuscaloosa. Foster had 27 stitches put in his back in June 2017 after being hit by a car while on his dirt bike.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-foster/3200464f-5363-3097-c0bc-5d4f423cb6ba
Josh Frazier,"Even though Frazier was a top-100 recruit nationally and an all-state pick in Arkansas, he struggled to find the field regularly in his first two years in Tuscaloosa. He played in six games as a true freshman (one tackle, which went for a loss) and as a sophomore (four stops). In 2016, his playing time increased, taking part in 14 contests and making eight tackles, one for loss, as a key reserve. Alabama found a spot for Frazier's thick, powerful frame in 2017, playing him in all 14 games as a top back-up. He posted 15 tackles, 2.5 for loss, three pass break-ups, and a forced fumble on the year.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-frazier/32004652-4177-7335-adcd-0748582ce707
Greg Gilmore,"Gilmore and some of his teammates are known for a workout routine where they push cars around to practice getting low off the snap to gain leverage. The five-star prospect and all-state pick from South Carolina had one start in his first two seasons with the Bayou Bengals. As a redshirt freshman, he played in six games as a reserve (four tackles, one-half sack). In 2015, Gilmore played in all 12 games, starting once and making 13 tackles (1.5 for loss, one sack). The massive tackle did start 12 games in 2016, compiling 34 stops, one for loss. Gilmore became more of a playmaker in his senior season, starting all 13 games, and racking up 53 tackles, 10 for loss, and a team-high 7.5 sacks from the inside.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/greg-gilmore/32004749-4c77-8461-770d-ef2b2563734d

The first-team all-state pick in football (115 tackles, 1,087 rushing yards, 17 touchdowns) also played basketball and both sprinted and threw shot put/discus for the track and field squad. Ginda made a quick impression in San Jose, earning 12 starts in 13 games played as a true freshman. The team's Freshman of the Year was credited with 80 tackles, 4.5 for loss, and three pass breakups on the season. He started 10 of 12 games played the next season, leading the Spartans with 99 tackles and 11.5 tackles for loss while also racking up 6.5 sacks, an interception, and two forced fumbles. Ginda got on NFL scouts' radars by leading the country with 173 tackles (94 solos) and also creating 13 tackles for loss, two sacks, three pass breakups, and three forced fumbles to garner first-team All-Mountain West recognition.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/frank-ginda/32004749-4e06-9214-dd21-76ef7fabb113
Austin Golson,"Golson signed with Ole Miss as a top-five tackle prospect from Prattville, Alabama (which is about an hour from Auburn), but the failing health of his grandparents caused him to make the difficult decision to transfer closer to home. Golson played in 12 games as a reserve guard in Oxford before the transfer, then sat out the 2014 season. He stepped in as the starting center for 11 games in 2015, missing two-plus games with a knee injury. Golson stayed healthy for all 13 contests as a junior, starting the first four at left tackle before shifting back to the pivot where he took advantage of his athleticism in pass protection and combo-blocking to the second level. He again changed positions during his senior campaign, starting four games at center, two at right tackle, another at left guard, and the other seven contests at left tackle for the SEC West champs.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-golson/3200474f-4c68-4054-20a5-679c9c55c8fa
James Hearns,"While many believed Devonte Fields would be the Cardinals' top pass rusher in 2016, Hearns actually earned that title, looking strong on the edge and showing a burst to the quarterback. He was an honorable mention All-ACC selection after making 43 stops, 11 for loss, eight sacks, and five forced fumbles (tied for fifth in the FBS) on the year. Hearns' year did not end on a happy note, however, as he was shot in the elbow at an off-campus apartment while celebrating his teammate, Lamar Jackson's winning of the Heisman Trophy. Hearns only started eight of 13 games played in 2017, but still made 42 stops, 13.5 for loss, seven sacks, three pass breakups, and four forced fumbles. His career started off slowly despite being a top 200 prospect nationally, with an injury ending his true freshman season just two games in. Hearns played just two games in his redshirt freshman season, as well, before finally getting a chance as a reserve the following year (12 tackles in 12 games, including three stops in the Music City Bowl).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-hearns/32004845-4145-0963-2447-1fe4c4580f23

He was a big hit with Demon Deacons' coaches, starting 11 of 12 games at center in 2013 to earn freshman All-American honors. Helms started all 12 games as a sophomore, the first seven at left guard and the final five in the middle. His grandmother fell ill, however, so he decided to transfer closer to home. He redshirted for the Gamecocks in 2015 before getting the starting nod in 2016. Helms began the 2016 season-opener at center for USC, but moved to right guard for the last 12 games.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cory-helms/32004845-4c52-6443-ea4a-b706bd9dbb33
Kyle Hicks,"As one of the top high school running backs in Texas, Hicks could have gone anywhere to play college football. He committed to Texas initially but eventually decided Fort Worth was the place for him. It took until his redshirt junior year to show his speed, toughness, and quick open-field cuts on a regular basis. Hicks was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick in 2016, covering 1,042 yards and scoring 12 times (including five against Baylor) in 203 carries on the year (with 13 receptions, 104 yards, touchdown). He was a backup while playing in every game his first two years with the Horned Frogs, running for 160 yards on 46 totes as a freshman and 262 yards and three touchdowns on 55 attempts in 2015 (12 receptions, 118 yards). Hicks was arrested for public intoxication at a Whataburger restaurant near the TCU campus in January 2017. He still managed to start 11 of 13 games played in the fall, missing parts of three games with an injury. Hicks shared carries with Darius Anderson, receiving 139 carries that covered 637 yards with four touchdowns (30 receptions, 291 yards, one touchdown).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-hicks/32004849-4353-3938-fc4a-fef44872151d

He redshirted his first year with the Tribe, and then earned a starting job in eight games at left guard in 2014 -- his spot on the line for four years. Hilland missed four games due to injury that year and another one his sophomore year. He still managed to garner third-team All-Colonial Athletic Association honors in 11 starts in 2015, however. The injury bug hit him again in 2016, as he sat out the final two games of the year after starting the first nine. Hilland was a senior team captain in 2017 and finally stayed healthy, starting all 11 contests and receiving first-team All-CAA notice.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/connor-hilland/32004849-4c65-6271-402b-70c9941fb6bc

Colorado presented the opportunity, and they took it. Sean played for four years at tight end (18 starts, 24 catches) and Jeromy has become a stalwart of the offensive line for the Buffaloes, a two-time team captain and three-year starter at left tackle. The 2017 honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick had a rough start to his senior year, however, missing the first two games with a suspension. He started the remaining 10 games at left tackle. Irwin was a second-team All-Pac-12 pick as a junior, starting 12 times on his way to being named the team's top lineman (missing one due to illness). Irwin played just two games in 2015, missing the rest of the season with a torn ACL. He also missed the 2013 season after breaking a bone in his foot while doing yardwork in the summer.

He redshirted playing linebacker with the scout team in 2013, but moved back to defensive end for the following fall, starting two of 14 games played (eight tackles, 1.5 for loss). James started once in 12 games in 2015 (17 tackles, two for loss, one sack) before breaking out as a junior.

He's a better fit on the defensive end due to his aggressive nature, however. After suffering a broken fibula in the fifth game of his senior year, Laguda had to go the junior college route. He was an honorable mention all-conference performer at Butler Community College in his one season there. Laguda got a chance to head to Boulder for the 2015 season, and he took advantage by starring on special teams, earning the team's award for most outstanding coverage unit achievement.

The son of a former Philadelphia Phillies minor league baseball player (Jeff) was a good ballplayer himself, as well as an all-state grappler in wrestling-crazy Iowa. Lanning was also the Class 4A Player of the Year in football as a senior, leading his team to a state title with 2,135 yards through the air and 1,082 on the ground. He redshirted in Ames in 2013, then played in one game on special teams as the backup quarterback the following year. Lanning got his shot at quarterback at the end of 2015, as he started the final five games, playing in 11 total contests that year, completing 55.4 percent of his passes for 1,247 yards and 10 touchdowns against four interceptions (94 carries, 330 yards, four touchdowns rushing). He was a co-captain in 2016, but only started nine of 12 games (58.6 percent completion, 1,290 passing yards, nine touchdowns, three interceptions; 121 carries, 518 yards, 11 touchdowns rushing). Lanning ended the season with 121 straight passes without an interception. Before the 2017 season, Lanning was asked by his coaches to move to middle linebacker and he agreed. All he did in that one season in the middle was lead the team in tackles with 114 (11 for loss, six sacks), intercept one pass, and break up two others in 13 starts. He also rushed the ball 40 times for 135 yards and two scores and threw a few passes (3-of-4, 47 yards, touchdown).

The former high school powerlifter was ready to play right away, earning time in all 12 games as a true freshman (23 tackles) and getting some time on offense (three-yard touchdown, two-point conversion). Lawler earned the starting job as a sophomore, lining up for every game and leading the Mustangs with 64 tackles, nine for loss while compiling five sacks. His break-out season came in 2016, garnering first-team All-American Athletic Conference accolades, racking up 65 stops and leading the team with 15 tackles for loss and six sacks.

Lowell's been his own man despite following Star, winning all-state honors from the Salt Lake Tribune as a high school senior and then excelling for his hometown team. Lotulelei played in all 13 games as a true freshman, starting the final nine contests of the year (33 tackles, 4.5 for loss, four sacks). He was a first-team Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick that season, taking on double teams and attacking the ball when in his sights. Again starting nine of 13 games played as a sophomore, he was named first-team all-conference by league coaches after making 26 stops, five for loss, a sack, and a forced fumble (which led to the deciding touchdown in the team's Las Vegas Bowl win over rival BYU). Lotulelei received honorable mention All-Pac-12 recognition for his exploits in 2016, posting 28 tackles, 8.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks. He again came alive in Utah's bowl game, making three tackles, one for loss against Indiana in the Foster Farms Bowl.

Brad Lundblade,"Though Lundblade was an excellent student and a two-time first-team All-State pick from Argyle, Texas, he did not get scholarship offers from major programs. He liked Stillwater enough to walk on, and coaches put him in seven games, with one start, in his true freshman year. Lundblade received a scholarship before the 2015 season, and started every game up front for the Cowboys. He started all 13 games as a junior and every game his senior season, as well, earning first-team All-Big 12 accolades for his efforts. Lundblade was a first-team Academic All-American in 2016, and a finalist of the William V. Campbell Award (the academic Heisman) this season. Lundblade won state titles in discus (three times) and shot put (twice) in high school and his father, Kirk, played basketball at SMU.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brad-lundblade/32004c55-4e28-2688-125e-e9d041322bd3
Frankie Luvu,"Luvu grew up in American Somoa, starring for his high school team (which never lost during his career) as a defender and kicker (90 percent of kickoffs went for touchbacks) before heading to Pullman. Four years later, his parents made their first trip to see him play, capping off an honorable mention All-Pac-12 campaign (48 tackles, 12 for loss, 6.5 sacks, two interceptions) on the team's Senior Day. Luvu really started making his mark on the field as a junior, starting eight games and compiling 46 stops, seven for loss, and 1.5 sacks. The team took his redshirt off in 2014 to play him on special teams the final eight contests (three tackles), and his contributions increased the following year as he made 13 stops in 12 games as a reserve.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/frankie-luvu/32004c55-5665-2601-f81e-ce1ca7ecd501
Blake Mack,"Mack was a thick receiver when he reached the ASU campus, but has become a reliable playmaker as a tight end for the Red Wolves over the past couple of seasons. He played in 12 games as a reserve in his true freshman year (seven catches, 149 yards, one touchdown) and then in 10 contests as a backup the following season (seven catches, 86 yards). Mack's career turned the corner in 2016, as he garnered second-team All-Sun Belt Conference accolades with 34 receptions for a team-leading 652 yards and three touchdowns while starting 12 of 13 games played.

T.J. Martin,"Martin, a Florida native, transferred from John I. Leonard High School to William T. Dwyer in Palm Beach Garden for his senior year. He was a quarterback at Leonard, but moved to receiver at Dwyer and earned first-team all-county honors as well as being named a four-star recruit. He played in 12 games as a reserve as a true freshman, catching 16 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown while returning 25 kickoffs for 552 yards. As a sophomore, Martin became a focal point of the offense as a 13-game starter, racking up 64 receptions for 728 yards and seven touchdowns. He produced again in 2017, nabbing 70 passes for a team-high 831 yards and nine touchdowns in 11 starts, though he failed to make the all-conference squad. Martin was ""cut"" from the Cougars in November, according to head coach Mike Leach. The receiver was suspended for one contest for missing team activities and was warned that another violation could result in his dismissal. Martin apparently wished to be given his release, anyway, but decided to be an early entrant for the NFL Draft.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-martin/32004d41-5273-5621-9f43-c8702dea86cc

He earned All-Mountain East accolades three straight years, including first-team notice in 2016 (47 tackles, 13.5 for loss, 5.5 sacks) and 2017 (58 tackles, 14.5 for loss, 8.5 sacks). The NDC leader in career tackles for loss and sacks garnered second-team All-MEC honors in 2015, making 60 tackles, 10.5 for loss, and seven sacks.

McCloud played in all 14 games of the team's national championship run, starting five contests. He caught 49 passes for 472 yards and two scores, as well as returning 21 punts for 176 yards. As a freshman, McCloud played in 12 games with one start, caught 29 throws for 251 yards and a touchdown, ran seven times for 48 yards, and averaged 31.9 yards on seven kickoff returns.

He garnered first-team All-Big 12 honors for the Wildcats, making all 38 of his extra point attempts, converting 21 of 26 field goal attempts (7 of 11 from 40-plus yards, with a long of 54), and sending 33 of 63 kickoffs into the end zone for touchbacks. McCrane struggled through his junior year, kicking in only eight games (11-14 field goals but none longer than 42 yards, 29-29 extra points) due to a leg injury from overworking it for kickoffs. He had been an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick the previous two years, earning freshman All-American accolades after leading the nation with a field goal percentage of 94.7 (18-19, 2-2 from 50-plus yards) and converting 41 of 42 extra points. McCrane set the school record for points by a freshman kicker with 94, beating Martin Gramatica's mark.

KC McDermott,"KC is one of three brothers to play college football. Tyler was a center for Colorado State and Shane was a center at Miami, with whom KC played one season after signing with the Hurricanes. KC was highly-recruited because of the family tradition, turning down Florida State, Alabama, and many others to follow Shane's path. He played in three games as a reserve as a true freshman in 2014, injured his knee and did not play the rest of the year. He took on a starting job in the final eight games of the 2015 season (six at left guard, two at right tackle).

Montrel Meander,"Meander was suspended indefinitely by Texas after facing a sexual assault charge but was later acquitted of the charge and subsequently transferred to Grambling. Meander's height, weight, and speed are high-end by NFL standards and even though he's still very raw as a safety, it is likely that teams will have him near the top of their priority free agent lists as they hope more experience and coaching can help him unlock those athletic traits on the field.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/montrel-meander/32004d45-4174-1192-e27a-642d7834f5a7
Steven Mitchell,"Mitchell changed his jersey number from seven to four in the hopes that his senior season would be his best -- and it seemed to have worked. The former top 150 national recruit and Los Angeles Times All-Area high school football selection struggled to stay healthy throughout his first four years with the Trojans. He tore ligaments in his right knee during the summer of 2013, and wound up redshirting the following fall. In 2014, Mitchell played in 11 games, starting two (seven receptions, 82 yards, two touchdowns) but missed two games with a knee sprain after missing spring practices with a knee injury and hernia. Mitchell started six games and played in 12 as a sophomore, missing two games with a sprained ankle but making 37 catches for 335 yards and four scores. Another knee injury shortened his junior season to seven games with three starts (24 receptions, 226 yards, one touchdown; five returns, 91 yards on kickoff returns).

Filipo, Sr. was an all-conference linebacker as a senior and was drafted in the eighth round by the Saints in 1986. The younger Mokofisi looks to be selected, as well, by posting two honorable mention All-Pac-12 seasons to complete his collegiate career.

Moore only played in eight games (25 tackles, four pass break-ups) before missing the rest of the year with a leg injury. He returned to start all 13 games as a junior, however, intercepting two passes and breaking up five others (43 tackles, 1.5 for loss).

Ryan Nall,"Nall was Oregon's Prep Football Player of the Year in 2013 with 1,684 yards and 22 touchdowns in his senior season (he was also a first-team all-state linebacker). OSU coaches figured him to be an H-back when he arrived on campus, playing him at tailback and H-back on the scout team. Injuries at running back forced him into the backfield in 2015, so he started two of 11 games played, rushing for 455 yards and three scores on 73 carries (he also had seven receptions, 109 yards receiving on the year).

While he has enough size to fit the NFL model for a roster spot, the arm talent is in question. He can deliver the football with good accuracy, but may not have the zip on his passes to keep the throwing windows from closing.

Demario Richard,"Richard was a four-year contributor for the Sun Devils after an outstanding high school career at Palmdale, California (4,251 yards, 63 touchdowns rushing over three years) that led him to be named one of the top 30 running back recruits in the country. As a true freshman, he earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors by rushing for 478 yards and four scores on just 84 carries (also catching 13 passes for 156 yards and four scores). He was named the Sun Bowl MVP after scoring four touchdowns in the victory over Duke. Richard led ASU with 1,104 rushing yards as a sophomore (210 carries, seven touchdowns) while making an impact in the passing game (31 receptions, 303 yards, three touchdowns). The following year, he started 10 of 11 games played, and led the team in rushing but shared carries with Kalen Ballage (593 yards, three touchdowns; 17 catches, 136 yards). Richard was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 selection as a senior, again leading the Sun Devils in rushing (198 carries, 1,027 yards, 12 touchdowns) and contributing as a receiver (eight catches, 67 yards).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demario-richard/32005249-4320-5293-a5fd-992247ae4119
Korey Robertson,"Robertson redshirted his first year with the Golden Eagles, following a high school career where he earned All-Mississippi honors as a senior. He played in all 14 games the following season, starting once and catching 14 passes for 200 yards and three scores. Robertson's production increased in 2016, again playing in all 13 games, starting five, making 37 receptions for 437 yards, and another three touchdowns. He really stepped up for Southern Miss in 2017, garnering first-team All-Conference USA honors after starting all 13 games, grabbing 76 passes for 1,106 yards and 12 touchdowns on the year before moving on to the NFL.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/korey-robertson/3200524f-4235-6746-6522-1e0367f0077a
Dominick Sanders,"Sanders was a three-star prospect and first-team All-Georgia from the Atlanta metro area that was rated as a receiver, athlete, and cornerback. Turned out his best position was safety, as he's scheduled to be a four-year starter there for the Bulldogs. Sanders was Georgia's Newcomer of the Year in 2014, starting 13 games (34 tackles, fumble return for touchdown) and intercepting two passes against Louisville in the Belk Bowl. He was voted second-team All-SEC by league coaches the following year, starting 12 of 13 games played, making 48 tackles, five for loss, one sack, six pass breakups, and leading the team with six interceptions, returning them for a school-record 205 yards. Sanders started 13 games again in 2016, also pacing the Bulldogs with three interceptions to go along with 34 tackles and seven pass breakups. He started all 15 games for the SEC champs as a senior, posting 37 stops, 3.5 for loss, a team-high four interceptions, and five pass breakups. Dominick's brother, Chris, also played at Georgia, though he was dismissed for an off-field incident and eventually ended up at Baylor.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dominick-sanders/32005341-4e28-8380-4774-597d407bc925
Dante Sawyer,"Sawyer stood out among the best high school players in the country in 2014, as he had three sacks during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. The top 100 national recruit, however, could not make the grades to get into South Carolina. East Mississippi Community College was happy to have him, though, and he helped them win a national title in his freshman season (21 tackles, 10.5 for loss, 6.5 sacks).  Sawyer made it to Columbia for the 2015 season, where he started four of 11 games played (17 tackles, 2.5 sacks). Sawyer played in all 13 games in 2016 (25 tackles, four for loss) despite having shoulder surgery in the offseason. He played a bigger role as a senior, starting three of 12 games played and earning second-team All-SEC honors from league media with 30 tackles, five for loss, three sacks, five pass breakups. He also tied for the FBS lead with five forced fumbles.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dante-sawyer/32005341-5712-9430-5eec-f7f0af9419ed
Austin Schlottmann,"Schlottman (pronounced SCHOLTE-mun) has a tackle build, and was recruited at that position after earning first-team All-Texas honors as a high school senior (no sacks allowed as a senior). But after playing in all 13 games as a reserve his freshman year in Fort Worth, he started four of 13 games played in 2015, one at right guard and three at center for the injured Joey Hunt. He kept the starting job in the pivot as a junior, garnering second-team All-Big 12 accolades from league coaches for his movement skills in the run game and ability to mirror and anchor in pass protection. Schlottman missed two games with a leg injury in 2016, but started all 14 games at center as a senior, garnering honorable mention all-conference honors.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-schlottmann/32005343-4824-3742-b68e-c1ec7beb6be9
Cam Serigne,"Serigne (pronounced SAIR-in-yay) has been a consistent producer from the tight end position since his redshirt year of 2013. The All-Virginia and All-Washington, D.C. Metro selection as a high school senior was the Deacon's leading receiver as a freshman in 2014 (54-531, five touchdowns), setting records for receptions by a tight end and by a redshirt freshman. He was an honorable mention All-ACC selection the following year, starting 11 of 12 games played, catching 46 passes for 562 yards and four touchdowns. Though Serigne's numbers went down (30-426, three touchdowns) as Wake's passing game struggled for consistency in 2016, scouts saw the strong hands, agility, and toughness after the catch to consider him a draftable H-back prospect. His senior campaign only increased his value, as he earned first-team All-ACC honors with 44 receptions for 556 yards and nine touchdowns.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-serigne/32005345-5241-0040-3003-53e3b2d8b932
Conor Sheehy,"Sheehy (SHEE-hee) plays like a try-hard, lightly-recruited player from Wisconsin, but he was actually a four-star prospect from Milwaukee that was a two-time All-State pick who finished second at a national powerlifting competition as a sophomore. He played in all 14 games as a reserve his true freshman season (two tackles, one for loss), and then earned eight starts in 13 games played the following season (31 stops, three for loss, two sacks).

Nic Shimonek,"Shimonek found it difficult to earn playing time during his first four collegiate seasons, and in fact, had the time to start a furniture restoration business to pay for school. The two-time honorable mention all-state pick from Mildred, Texas signed with the University of Iowa before the 2013 season. He redshirted there before deciding to transfer closer to home at Texas Tech. After sitting out as a redshirt in 2014, he played in just two games the following year (1-of-2, 18 yards). Shimonek was Pat Mahomes' back-up in 2016, playing well in limited action over four contests (38-of-58, 65.5 completion percentage, 464 yards, six touchdowns, one interception). Shimonek started throughout the 2016 season until Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury benched him for the regular season finale against Texas. The resilient senior told his coach that he was ""almost out of time,"" so Kingsbury put his young passer in the game. Two touchdowns later, the Red Raiders pulled out the win. The faith Kingsbury put in Shimonek paid off again in 2017, as he led the team to the Alamo Bowl and garnered honorable mention All-Big 12 notice by starting 12 of 13 games played, completing 66.5 percent of his passes (among the FBS leaders) for 3,963 yards and 33 touchdowns against 10 interceptions.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nic-shimonek/32005348-4924-8700-d5e6-918c689d3863
Antonio Simmons,"Workout warrior whose impressive combination of speed and power is sure to catch the attention of teams looking for a designated pass rusher with traits. Simmons lacks the overall length, bend, and handwork to fully capitalize on his testing numbers and he may need time on a practice squad to continue to improve his pass rush approach. Simmons doesn't play with the sand in his pants to hold the edge so he'll have to make the necessary strides as a rusher to have a chance to make a team down the road.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antonio-simmons/32005349-4d10-9812-c183-3f080ecd86c2
Van Smith,"Smith was one of the Tigers' best defensive backs during their national championship journey in 2016, earning second-team All-ACC honors as a sophomore by compiling 114 tackles, two interceptions, two pass breakups, and two forced fumbles in 15 starts. He was a solid player again in 2017, starting 12 games, posting 54 stops, 1.5 for loss, and an interception. Smith played 14 games as a true freshman, mostly on special teams, making 16 stops and an interception during the season. He was a three-phase star in high school, rushing for 444 yards and 13 touchdowns on just 66 carries, returning two kickoffs for touchdowns, and intercepting six passes his senior year.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/van-smith/3200534d-4976-9370-922c-5aaf98220ec6
Arrion Springs,"Springs was told by those around him not to play defense because of leg issues he'd had since birth (pigeon-toed feet, bowlegged). He ignored that advice to become an All-Area pick in San Antonio (63 tackles, four interceptions as a senior) and top-10 cornerback prospect nationally. Springs played immediately as a freshman as a reserve and on special teams, making three tackles. He earned a starting spot his sophomore year, making 53 stops, intercepting one pass, tying for the team lead with 12 pass breakups, and two forced fumbles. Again the team relied on him to start nine of 12 games in 2016 (39 tackles, 3.5 for loss, team-best 12 pass breakups). Springs saved his best for last, garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice by starting 12 of 13 games played and leading the team with 18 pass breakups. He also had 42 tackles, four for loss, an interception, and one sack on the year.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/arrion-springs/32005350-5226-6361-2478-e3050b70765d
Linden Stephens,"The son of former Minnesota Gophers and NFL (Vikings, Jets) linebacker Mac Stephens has piqued scouts' interest with his play at cornerback. He played one season at Fork Union Military Academy prior to joining the Bearcats and then suited up for all 13 games as a reserve defender (19 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups) in 2014. Stephens started seven of 13 games played the following year, picking off two passes. Though he lined up with the first-team in only two of 12 games as a junior, Stephens intercepted two more passes and broke up seven others. Stephens started all 12 games in 2017, posting 51 tackles, intercepting one pass and breaking up eight more.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/linden-stephens/32005354-4541-9047-173e-c83985c34dbc
Jamar Summers,"Summers earned a national reputation in 2015 by intercepting eight passes during his sophomore season, tying for second in the country in that category. He was a first-team All-American Athletic Conference pick (39 tackles, three pass breakups) that year. The brother of former Iowa State, NFL, and CFL linebacker Alvin Bowen struggled a bit in coverage as a junior the next year, getting moved to safety at times to keep the action in front of him but still starting all 12 games (59 tackles, four for loss, two interceptions, nine pass breakups). Summers played every game, starting five, as a freshman (22 tackles, interception, two pass breakups) following a semester at Milford Academy prep school after high school. Summers was demoted to the second team during 2017 spring practices because head coach Randy Edsell thought a message needed to be sent about consistency. He was an 11-game starter as a hybrid defensive back in 2017, making 63 stops and collecting one sack, one interception, seven pass breakups, and a forced fumble.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamar-summers/32005355-4d49-6878-c9e3-aba2c7d756ef
Corey Thompson,"Thompson spent six years in Baton Rouge, missing two years with injuries (2014-torn ACL, 2016-broken leg) and redshirting his first year on campus while recovering from a shoulder injury from high school. The four-star recruit played in 13 games as a safety and on special teams in 2012 (11 tackles). Thompson started five of 10 games played in 2013, missing the final two contests due to the knee injury that kept him out the following year. In 2015, Thompson started three of nine games played at free safety (15 tackles). Defensive coordinator Dave Aranda moved Thompson to a coverage linebacker spot for the 2017 season, and he had his best season (eight starts in 12 games, 43 stops, seven for loss, six sacks) despite not being with the team for the Citrus Bowl. His father, Tony Thompson, was a receiver at Texas A&M from 1985 to 1987 and his mother, Dyan Webber, was a track All-American at Texas Southern.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-thompson/32005448-4f50-5419-d96a-1d50577a9ef4
Henre' Toliver,"Toliver made a name for himself as a true freshman in 2014, first taking on Alabama's superstar receiver Julio Jones and limited him to two catches for 22 yards. Then, he intercepted a pass against Texas in the Razorbacks' bowl victory. For the year, he played in 11 games, starting once, posting 18 tackles, picking two passes, and breaking up another. Toliver started 10 of 13 games as a sophomore, including the final four. He was credited with 55 stops, four for loss, an interception, and eight pass breakups. Though Toliver was kept off all-conference teams due to the depth at the position in the SEC, he played well as a  junior in 2016 (45 tackles, two interceptions -- one returned for a touchdown, six pass breakups), showing toughness and inside-outside versatility. He wasn't an all-conference pick as a senior, either, though he played well (43 tackles, three interceptions, eight pass breakups).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henre-toliver/3200544f-4c42-4549-ba13-d6b0d8769d6e
Shane Tripucka,"Tripucka waited this turn while Drew Kaser drew praise from NFL scouts in 2014 and 2015, punting in just one game in two season after redshirting the 2013 campaign. He was no slouch himself, as he allowed zero punt return yards over his two seasons as a starter in high school to earn Under Armour All-American honors. With Kaser moving on to the NFL in 2016, Tripucka took advantage of the opportunity to finish seventh in the FBS with a 41.6-yard net punt average (42.9 gross). He also set a school record with 27 punts placed inside the 20 yard-line while producing zero touchbacks -- a highly unusual statistical feat. Tripucka fared well as a senior, averaging 45.5 yards per punt, forcing 33 fair catches on 83 punts, placing 26 inside the 20 against six touchbacks. Tripucka's family has a history of athletic prowess. His father, Chris, played football at Boston College. His uncle, Kelly, played basketball at Notre Dame and for 10 seasons in the NBA. Shane's grandfather, Frank, played quarterback at Notre Dame and for 15 seasons in the NFL; his number 18 jersey is retired as part of being on the Denver Broncos' Ring of Fame, though Peyton Manning was allowed to wear it during his time in Denver.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shane-tripucka/32005452-4976-4123-7dbd-624cdeb80a28
Leka Uhatafe,"Salesi ""Leka"" Uhatafe (pronounced sah-less-ee lekka oo-ha-tah-feh) suffered a terrible tragedy in July 2013 when he fell asleep behind the wheel of a car heading 1,200 miles from Salt Lake City to Texas. He lost both of his brothers and a good friend, fellow Utah football player Gaius Vaenuku, while he and his father survived. Uhatafe redshirted the season following the accident and then earned a starting role at right guard for five of 13 games played in 2014. He played in all 13 games as a sophomore, starting seven times at that right guard spot. Uhatafe finally locked down the lead role for all 13 games in 2016, displaying a combination of size, athleticism, and toughness that NFL scouts desire for a next¬ñlevel starter. Those traits came through in 2017, as Uhatafe was voted second-team All-Pac-12 by league coaches after starting all 13 games at left guard.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leka-uhatafe/32005548-4162-2937-1b8d-66e03674dcba
Azeem Victor,"Victor went from struggling with high school academics to graduating from the University of Washington in four years. He may have left school after an outstanding junior campaign if he had not suffered a broken right leg against USC in November. Despite playing in 10 games (all starts), Victor was voted first-team All-Pac-12 (67 tackles, three for loss) because of his willingness to chase any play or fill any hole with his strong presence. His aggression did get the best of him at times, like when he was suspended for the first half of the Oregon contest that year after being ejected for a targeting call against USC. His senior season did not end as expected, with a suspension after a DUI charge leading Victor starting just five times in nine games (30 tackles, two for loss, three pass breakups). Victor played well as a sophomore starter (11 of 13 games played), garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice with 95 stops, nine for loss, 1.5 sacks, an interception (returned for a touchdown) and six pass breakups. He made an impact on special teams early in his career, receiving the team's Special Teams Scout Squad MVP award during his 2013 redshirt season, and then playing in 10 games on coverage units -- making two of his five tackles for the year against Washington State in the Apple Cup.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/azeem-victor/32005649-4373-1253-a0a1-28fa0ecdf553
Ralph Webb,"Webb was no under-recruited bargain for Vanderbilt -- he was a first-team Class 6A All-State pick from Gainesville, Florida who ran for over 2,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. He was also a two-time state champ in the long jump. Now he's the top rusher in Vandy history, earning that title after just three seasons on the field. As a redshirt freshman, Webb was a freshman All-SEC pick with 907 yards and four scores on 212 attempts (10-30 receiving). He carried the load again as a sophomore, taking the ball 277 times and covering 1,152 yards with five scores while also receiving 22 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns. Webb started every game for the third straight year (37 consecutive) in 2016, garnering second-team All-SEC honors after setting a Commodores single-season rushing record with 1,283 yards while scoring 13 times on 250 totes (21-186 receiving). He displayed his tough-minded and patient running style by rushing for 111 yards and a touchdown in the team's loss to North Carolina State at the Independence Bowl. Webb completed his streak of 49 straight starts at the end of his junior year, covering 831 yards and scoring 10 times on 192 carries (13-188, one touchdown receiving).",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ralph-webb/32005745-4226-0877-48d8-50363c0aedb2
Taj Williams,"Traits-based prospect with raw talent who is lacking the fundamentals to make a 53-man roster early in his career.

Tre' Williams,"Talk about a well-rounded resume -- Williams was Coastal Alabama Defensive Player of the Year as a senior for Mobile's St. Paul's Episcopal School, while also being named Alabama's Class 5A Player of the Year in basketball and winning the state shot put championship as a junior. He played in 13 games, starting once, as a true freshman (16 tackles). Williams split time on the weak side in 2015, making 55 stops, four for loss, starting three of 12 games played. He earned six starts (11 games) as a junior, and was credited with 67 stops, 3.5 for loss, and a sack. Williams used his athleticism, hard hits, and experience to lead the Tigers' defense in 2017, though he could only start eight of 11 games played due to an injured right shoulder. He was credited with 50 tackles and 2.5 sacks on the season, garnering second-team All-SEC honors from league coaches despite the injury.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-williams/32005749-4c54-7502-7da3-36fe45b2a67f
Chucky Williams,"The Cardinals defense lost its starting secondary after the 2014 season due to underclassmen defections and graduating seniors. Williams stepped into a starting role that next season (12 of 13 games played), making 57 tackles, intercepting three passes, and breaking up four others. He had only played in nine games as a reserve in 2014 (six tackles) and redshirted his first year on campus the year before. As a junior in 2016, Williams again was a full-time starter (61 tackles, two for loss, three interceptions, seven pass breakups). He followed that up with an excellent senior season, starting all 13 games, compiling 80 tackles, three interceptions, five pass breakups, and three forced fumbles. In high school, Williams was a four-star recruit from south Florida who originally signed on with Ole Miss before switching to Louisville.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chucky-williams/32005749-4c18-9258-830a-71bf3f1d93b7
Jeff Wilson,"Wilson rushed for more than 5,000 yards and 60 touchdowns over his last two high school seasons, earning all-state recognition each year. Still, he was rated a two-star prospect and wound up in Denton. As a freshman, Wilson played in a reserve role (50 rushes, 224 yards, one touchdown; five receptions, 41 yards, one touchdown). He first led the Mean Green in rushing in 2015 (155 attempts, 830 yards, one touchdown; 12 receptions, 71 yards; 12 kick returns for 279 yards), despite missing two games due to injury (he started seven of 10 games played). Wilson also missed two games with an injury in 2016 but managed to lead the team in rushing again (169 carries, 936 yards) and scored 14 times on the ground.

Ethan Wolf,"Brothers Ethan and Eli Wolf (redshirt freshman) were a two-headed monster at tight end for the Vols in 2017. The older sibling has already made his presence felt in Knoxville, starting 35 and suiting up for all 38 games the team has played since arriving on campus. He caught 23 passes for 212 yards as a freshman, then made 23 receptions for 301 yards and two scores in 2015. As a junior, he caught 21 passes for 239 and two scores. Despite the Volunteers' issues in the passing game in 2017, Wolf caught 24 passes for 246 yards and three scores. Wolf has potential as a receiver and blocker as he continues to build strength, as he's a natural athlete and his effort is strong.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ethan-wolf/3200574f-4c11-5032-a08f-87eb4c379ec2
Logan Woodside,"Woodside has not had an easy go of things at Toledo. The Frankfort, Kentucky native, a first-team all-state pick before coming to the Rockets, played in four games with one start in 2013 (21-for-41, 240 yards, touchdown). The following year, Woodside took over the starting role early on due to a season-ending injury to Alabama transfer Phillip Ely (62.5 completion percentage, 2,263 yards, 19 touchdowns, eight interceptions). He helped the Rockets beat Arkansas State in the GoDaddy.com Bowl at the end of the year, going 21-for-27 for 176 yards. He lost the starting job to Ely before the 2015 season, however, and redshirted to maintain his eligibility. Coaches had to start him the next year, though, and he excelled in executing the team's quick-throw offense. Woodside garnered first-team All-MAC honors as a junior, completing 69 percent of his passes for 4,129 yards, and leading the nation with 45 touchdown passes (against just nine interceptions). Woodside's numbers took a step back in his final season as he threw for just 3,882 yards and 28 touchdowns with eight interceptions.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/logan-woodside/3200574f-4f62-9467-6326-adb124a79e35
Chris Worley,"Ted Ginn, Sr. has put together an outstanding football program at Glenville High, where Worley starred as a senior (five sacks, five interceptions returned for touchdowns, five forced fumbles) before signing with Ohio State. Ginn apparently had gotten Worley ready to play, as the young man started his first game with the Buckeyes in 2014 (Navy) and then went on to play in 14 games as a reserve and on special teams for the eventual national champions (11 tackles). He contributed more regularly as a sophomore, playing in 12 contests and making 17 stops, 1.5 for loss, and a sack. Finally given a chance to start, Worley took over at outside linebacker for all 13 games, recording 70 tackles, 4.5 for loss, and four pass breakups.

Deon Yelder,"One-year wonder who lacks desired height and length but who plays with some grit as a run blocker. Yelder appears to offer some early straight line speed, but he may be too tight in his lower half to be able to shake coverage underneath with separation out of his route breaks. He flashes potential as a run blocker but lacks consistency of technique from game to game. Yelder doesn't stand out in any one phase, but it stands to reason that he should continue to improve in all areas with more experience and coaching.",5.4,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deon-yelder/32005945-4c04-6686-b6e5-55cf4fb5878b
Parris Bennett,"Bennett's quickness and athleticism served the Orange well the past three seasons. The All-State pick from Detroit began his career as a reserve, playing in eight games (four tackles, one for loss). He earned a starting role as a sophomore, but could only play in eight games before an injury ended his season prematurely (44 stops, 3.5 for loss, one interception). Bennett started all 12 games as a junior, garnering honorable mention All-ACC honors by leading the team with 110 tackles (6.5 for loss), intercepting one pass, and breaking up three others. He was the team's leading tackler again in 2017, posting 115 stops and a team-high 11 tackles for loss that included two sacks. Bennett was named second-team All-ACC by league coaches after the season.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/parris-bennett/32004245-4e40-3358-a577-daf8517039c1
Mike Boone,"Boone was rated as a wide receiver by high school recruiting services, as he caught 57 passes for 1,068 yards and 18 touchdowns for Baker County High in Florida. It's easy to see why he chose to be a tailback for the Bearcats, however, with his compact build and bullish running style. Coaches thought he would redshirt to learn a new position, but they were forced to play him due to injuries; Boone ended up leading the team with 650 rushing yards (just 101 carries) and scored nine times in nine games. He played in 11 games (one start) the following year, covering 749 yards and nine scores on 104 totes while splitting time with Hosey Williams. Boone's junior year was somewhat disappointing (105 carries, 388 yards, two touchdowns, 20 catches, 249 receiving yards, 21 kick returns for 506 yards in nine games) because of lingering injuries, including a foot malady that ultimately cost him the end of the season. He still played in 10 games, starting nine, as a senior in 2017 (110 carries, 484 yards, four touchdowns; 24 catches, 177 yards, one touchdown reception).",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-boone/3200424f-4f45-2495-f003-8085a5aa378e
Cole Boozer,"The tape isn't kind to Boozer as it relates to his NFL prospects, but to be fair, he is still very early in his transition to tackle and he's added more weight since the season ended. While it may be unlikely that Boozer gets a Day 3 call, teams love the opportunity to work with tight ends turned tackles and he might land on a practice squad for a year or two as an offensive line project if teams can find enough to work with at either tackle or center.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cole-boozer/3200424f-4f75-3865-e88b-e4ea840e7c2b
Drew Brown,"Brown is the younger sibling of former Husker All-American and long-time NFL kicker Kris Brown. After a successful high school career at powerhouse Southlake Carroll High School in Texas, he decided to follow his older (by 19 years) brother's footsteps to Lincoln. Coaches didn't wait to see if he could handle the job, as he stepped forward to handle placekicking duties as a true freshman in 2014 (59-of-59 extra points, 14-of-21 field goals, 2-of-7 from 40-plus yards). Drew beat Kris' freshman scoring record with 101 points on the year. He had an honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore year in 2015 (44-of-46 extra points, 21-of-27 field goals, 13-of-17 from 40-plus yards out), tying an NCAA record with five field goals in one half, including a 50-yarder (Southern Miss). Brown's junior year came after a tragic car accident where Nebraska punter Sam Foltz passed away (Brown was going to the same destination that night, but was in a different car). He converted 12-of-14 field goal attempts in his junior season (1-of-2 from 50-plus yards) and made all 38 extra point attempts. Brown's statistics were almost exactly the same in his final year with the Cornhuskers, as he made 12-of-14 field goals again (long of 44 yards, no attempts from over 50 yards, one blocked) and all 37 extra point attempts. He also had 28 touchbacks on 60 kickoffs.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/drew-brown/32004252-4f40-8210-e5d5-42bdc842679b
Martez Carter,"Carter had a rough upbringing in Monroe, Louisiana, with both his older brother and father spending time in prison while his mom worked constantly to feed him and his other siblings. Carter was academically ineligible his senior year of high school, then attended Wiley College in Texas to play basketball until he received an opportunity to walk on at Grambling as a defensive back. Carter received a few touches on offense in 2014 (two carries, seven yards rushing, one reception, two yards receiving) but was primarily the team's kickoff returner (24.1-yard average, touchdown). The following year he was moved to running back -- a move that paid immediate dividends as he earned second-team All-SWAC honors as a rotation back (111 carries, 876 yards, nine touchdowns rushing; 12 receptions, 134 yards, four touchdowns receiving; 25.7-yard average, two touchdown kick returns). Carter was a first-team All-Conference selection as a junior, rushing for 891 yards and 10 scores while upping his receiving totals (28 receptions, 376 yards, three touchdowns) and continuing as a kick (23.3-yard average, touchdown) and punt (19 returns, 182 yards) returner.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/martez-carter/32004341-5271-6509-b950-e4367087e5b5
Secdrick Cooper,"Cooper was an all-district selection in Louisiana as a high school senior, so his signing with Tech was not a big surprise. Conference USA coaches named him one of the top freshmen in the league in 2014, as he made 14 stops in 14 games as a reserve defensive back. Cooper did not start as a sophomore, either, but had 23 stops, 1.5 for loss, and two pass breakups in 13 games. His junior year ended in honorable mention all-conference honors, starting 13 of 14 games played and compiling 73 tackles, 6.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, and seven pass breakups. League coaches voted him first-team all-conference in 2017 after he started 11 of 12 games played (missed the opener with a hamstring), compiling 68 tackles, 2.5 for loss, three interceptions, two pass breakups, and one blocked kick.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/secdrick-cooper/3200434f-4f73-7832-6136-0a863b74ca8d
Curtis Cothran,"When James Franklin came to Penn State, he asked Cothran to gain weight to move from defensive end to defensive tackle. Sixty pounds later, the former Pennsylvania All-State pick became a two-year starter on the interior for the Nittany Lions. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2017. Cothran's junior year had its ups and downs, as he started eight of 10 games played (21 tackles, 4.5 for loss) but he was also suspended for four games for violating team rules. Cothran's five tackles, three for loss, against Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game ended that season on a high note. He had played all 13 games as a reserve defensive end in 2015 (16 tackles, four for loss, 2.5 sacks) following a freshman year where saw action in just one game, recording one tackle for loss.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/curtis-cothran/3200434f-5405-2257-8b15-2caf867188b7
Parker Cothren,"Cothen is a blue-collar defensive tackle from Huntsville, Alabama, who earned Class 6A All-State honors as a high school senior. He earned a fair amount of playing time as a reserve in 13 games as a redshirt freshman in 2014 (11 tackles, 2.5 for loss) and as a sophomore in 2015 (13 tackles, 0.5 for loss). Cothren moved into the starting line-up in 2016, beginning all 13 games, posting 26 tackles, 5.5 for loss, and two sacks to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten recognition.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/parker-cothren/3200434f-5408-6007-33dc-7350a0428174
Justin Crawford,"Like many prospects, Crawford has done some travelling during his high school and college careers. He played at Gainesville High in Florida for two years before moving to Columbus, Georgia, where he came out ranked as a top-50 running back recruit after standing out at every skill position (and acting as the team's starting punter). Crawford signed on with Northwest Mississippi Community College in 2014, hitting the ground running (literally) with 1,551 yards and 14 scores (also 12 receptions, 306 yards receiving). He was the national JUCO Offensive Player of the Year, leading Northwest to its first national title in over 20 years (1,610 yards, 16 touchdowns rushing; 29 receptions, 394 yards, six touchdowns receiving). Crawford brought excitement to the Mountaineers in 2016, earning the Big 12 Newcomer of the Year award by rushing for 1,184 yards in 13 games (four starts) and averaging 7.3 yards per carry (ranking sixth in the FBS). His 331-yard effort against Oklahoma, showing off excellent acceleration and wild moves in the open field, put him on the national radar. Crawford is married and has two children.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-crawford/32004352-4167-7332-b2f4-6ce2de91b1b9
Trevor Darling,"As a Miami Central graduate (he won two state titles there), it was natural for him to sign on with the Hurricanes as a four-star recruit and top 150 national prospect. Darling played in eight games, starting five at right tackle, as a true freshman in 2014. The following year, he was the starting left tackle for all 13 games, even though he started training camp at his previous right tackle position. In 2016, he played 11 games as a junior, missing time with a leg injury, and started nine games at left tackle. Darling is not the largest tackle in the class, but his power, length, and foot quickness make him a potential starter at tackle or guard.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevor-darling/32004441-5238-7462-90d8-4fccc5c4c628
Gerhard de Beer,"De Beer marched to the United States from Pretoria, South Africa primarily to participate on Arizona's track and field squad as a discus thrower. He was a junior champion, and excelled for the Wildcats, winning the Pac-12 championship in that event in 2015. He also had decided to try out for the football team, knowing little about the sport but his experience with rugby gave him the physicality to succeed. He redshirted in 2013 and played with the scout team in 2014, bulking up and learning the game. De Beer finally got on the field in 2015, playing in all 13 games and starting the final four contests (one at right guard, three at left guard). As a junior, he received starts in eight of the first nine games before missing the final three due to injury. De Beer played in all 12 games of his senior campaign, starting nine at right tackle (first three, final six).",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gerhard-de-beer/32004445-4215-0981-d8fc-08384330fa6a
Danny Etling,"Etling began his career at Purdue, signing up as a four-star recruit and Elite 11 participant from California. Coaches got him on the field as a true freshman, playing him in eight games and starting him in the final seven; he completed 55.8 percent of his 267 passes for 1,690 yards, 10 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. Etling faced competition in his sophomore season from Austin Appleby, losing his job after going 2-3 to start the year (54.9 percentage, 800 yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions). After that benching, Etling decided to transfer to LSU, where he practiced with the scout team in 2015. Again he was the taking over early in the season as a junior, leading the Tigers to a 7-3 record and Citrus Bowl win. Etling completed 59.5 percent of his throws (160-of-269) for 2,123 yards, 11 touchdowns against five interceptions. He started all 13 games in 2017, completing 60 percent of his throws (165-of-275) for 2,463 yards and 16 touchdowns.

Jarvion Franklin,"Franklin didn't get a lot of looks from power five conference programs coming out of Tinley Park, Illinois, despite being a second-team all-state selection as a senior. Western Michigan bore immediate fruit from their signing of the big-bodied Franklin, however. He was a Freshman All-American and the first player to win both MAC Offensive Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year after covering 1,551 yards on 306 carries, scoring 24 times. Franklin also contributed 14 receptions for 163 yards and a touchdown. His sophomore season was not as productive, as a couple of fumbles and a running back-by-committee approach cut his carries exactly in half (153 attempts, 735 yards, five touchdowns; 17 receptions, 184 yards). Franklin was back in coaches' good graces for his junior year, running hard to garner second-team All-MAC honors (248 carries, 1,353 yards, 12 touchdowns; 25 receptions, 288 yards, two touchdowns) despite sharing carries with Jamauri Bogan. Franklin split carries with Bogan in 2017, as well, but still pounded out 1,228 yards and 11 scores on 235 carries (five receptions, 35 yards, one touchdown) to earn first-team all-conference notice.",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jarvion-franklin/32004652-4145-6765-f8f4-d193c47eb9b3
Damon Gibson,"Gibson grew up in a town of about 250 residents (Beardsley, Minnesota) that had to combine with two others (Clinton, Graceville) to field a football team. Therefore, it was easy to be overlooked by major colleges despite his status as an All-State dual-threat quarterback and star defensive back. He took the offer from MSM and ran with it, playing in eight games as a reserve receiver (10-93) and on special teams (five tackles on coverage units). Gibson began making a real impact the following year, earning honorable mention All-Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference-North honors as the team's leading receiver and 11-game starter (37-821, 22.2 per catch, six touchdowns). He finished his career with two first-team All-Conference nods, first as a junior, when he garnered AFCA Division II All-American status with a division-best 140.8 receiving yards a game (90-1,549, 17 touchdowns). Gibson's senior season was shorted the final four games due to injury, but he still caught 54 passes for 649 yards and three scores in eight starts. Gibson served as the Dragons' punter for part of the 2015 season (22 kicks, 29 yards per) and most of 2016 (52, 37.7).",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damon-gibson/32004749-4253-6464-cf64-6e0bdba2d92b

He started eight of 13 games played at safety, including the final four, compiling 73 tackles, four for loss, two interceptions, a pass break-up, and a forced fumble. Harris was a key reserve at safety and special teams in his freshman (12 games, seven tackles) and sophomore (one start in 12 games, 22 tackles) seasons. The Under Armour All-American was coveted by many of the top programs of the country coming out of Orlando's Dr. Phillips High School.

D'Ernest Johnson,"USF has risen to prominence as a program during its short history because of their landing of in-state four-star recruits like Johnson. The Immokalee product earned honorable mention All-State notice as a high school senior, then got playing time as a true freshman the next season (46-150 rushing; 8-107, one touchdown receiving; 8-157 kick returns). Johnson was the Bulls' Offensive Co-Most Valuable Player as a sophomore, producing as a runner (71-307, one touchdown), receiver (26-356, four touchdowns), and kick returner (21-563) despite starting just one of 13 games played. American Athletic Conference coaches voted him second-team All-Conference as a return specialist in 2016 (8-231 kick returns; 18-213, one touchdown punt return). Johnson also had a bigger role as a rusher, even through he did not start in 13 games played, carrying the ball 111 times for 543 yards and eight touchdowns. He also caught 28 passes for 293 yards and five scores. USF coaches put Johnson in the starting lineup nine times in 12 games in 2017, giving him the ball 193 times as a rusher, and he covered 796 yards and scored seven times.

Dalton Keene,"Keene actually made his name as a high school pass-catcher, setting Jacksonville, Illinois records in career receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns. But after sitting out 2013 as a redshirt for the Redbirds, he's been a force on the defensive line. He played in 15 games, starting four as a freshman (29 tackles, 2.5 for loss, one sack), including four tackles, two for loss, and a sack against North Dakota State in the FCS Championship Game. Keene was an honorable mention All-Missouri Valley Football Conference selection in 2015, starting all 13 games (59 tackles, 10 for loss, five sacks, three pass break-ups, safety, blocked kick). His junior year was also productive (67 stops, 7.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks, two blocked kicks), and he had a hand in ISU's win over Northwestern with two tackles for loss.

He started all 13 games on the year, making 66 tackles, 8.5 for loss, six sacks, and five pass breakups. LaCouture's father was a hockey player good enough to go to the University of Maine and help the Black Bears win the 1993 national title. Junior's game was football, however, and he rose to the top of the defensive lineman high school recruiting rankings in 2012 (he played in Texas before moving to Lincoln during his career). LaCouture played in every game as a true freshman, making 11 tackles as a reserve. He started every game as a sophomore, making 40 tackles, four for loss, and 2.5 sacks.

His other statistics dipped a bit in his junior season, however, before bouncing back in a first-team All-ACC senior campaign (18 fair catches in 2014, 24 in 2015, 12 in 2016, 24 in 2017; 21 punts inside the 20 yard-line in 2014, 21 in 2015, 12 in 2016, 16 in 2017).",5.1,2018,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-winslow/32005749-4e56-9792-72c3-463fe9d29dc0
Nick Bosa,"Ohio State's top defender figured to have a shot at attending the 2018 Heisman Trophy ceremony the way his junior season began. He started the first three games, making 14 tackles, six for loss, four sacks, and a forced fumble. However, an injured core muscle suffered in Week 3 forced him to spend the rest of the fall rehabbing and preparing for the draft. The Heisman hype was real due to his play in 2017, where he was named the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year and first-team all-conference selection (34 tackles, 15 for loss, eight sacks), despite starting only 4 of 14 games played. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., native contributed heavily his freshman year, as one would expect from one of the top five recruits in the country, playing in all 13 games and making 29 stops and five sacks. Bosa is the brother of Joey, the 2016 No. 3 overall pick for the San Diego Chargers, and son of John, the 1986 first-round pick of the Miami Dolphins.",7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-bosa/3200424f-5307-3285-8013-e0658c01933d
Jeffery Simmons,"Simmons did not make a good impression after signing on to play at Mississippi State. He was arrested for his part in a March 2016 fight, and a video of him repeatedly punching a woman made him a nationwide target for those wondering why colleges allow the enrollment and athletic participation of players with violent histories. He was found guilty of malicious mischief and pled no contest to simple assault, paying fines and restitution for the woman's medical bills. During his time in Starkville, however, he has had no incidents. He won the team's Newsom Award in the spring of 2018 for his work on the field, in the classroom and in the community. Simmons was a five-star recruit after helping Noxubee County High School win back-to-back Mississippi state titles his junior and senior seasons. He started 3 of 12 games played as a true freshman (40 tackles, 3.5 for loss), suspended only for the opener for his off-field incident. SEC coaches named him to their All-Freshman team. The following year, he was named first-team All-SEC after making 60 stops, 12 for loss, and five sacks for the Bulldogs. Simmons started all 13 games as a junior, again being voted first-team all-conference as well as an Associated Press third-team All-American. He started all 13 games in 2018, leading his team with 17 tackles for loss (including two sacks) among his 63 total stops.",7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeffery-simmons/32005349-4d20-4336-493b-a309c446eb8f
Rashan Gary,"Gary was the top recruit in the Class of 2016, not only using his immense size and outstanding agility to dominate the competition at Paramus Catholic High School in New Jersey as the state's top Defensive Player in 2014 and 2015, but also excelling in the classroom. He had followed former Wolverines star defender Jabrill Peppers at Catholic, and then again followed the path of the 2017 first-round pick of the Cleveland Browns to Ann Arbor. Gary played all 13 games as a reserve his freshman season, making 27 tackles, five for losses, and a sack. His potential really began to show in 2017, when he earned first-team All-Big Ten honors with 66 stops, 12 for loss, and six sacks in 13 starts. Gary was a first-team pick again as a junior, compiling 44 tackles, seven for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 12 games. He joined teammate Devin Bush and others in skipping Michigan's bowl game to prepare for the draft.",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashan-gary/32004741-5276-6759-8729-700e2dfb98cd
T.J. Hockenson,"The Hawkeyes have produced some good NFL tight ends over the past 15 years, from Dallas Clark excelling with the Indianapolis Colts a decade ago to San Francisco breakout star George Kittle. Hockenson and fellow junior Iowa tight end Noah Fant will become the next in line. The Chariton, Iowa, native was a three-time first-team all-state pick in high school and spent his first year on campus growing into a Big Ten tight end's frame. Iowa's two-tight end attack allowed him to excel as a redshirt freshman in 2016, making 24 for 320 yards (13.3 average) and three scores in 13 games (12 starts). Even sharing snaps with Fant in 2018, Hockenson won the John Mackey Award as the nation's top tight end and the Big Ten Tight End of the Year award, along with first-team all-conference honors. He started 13 contests in 2018, leading the team with 49 catches for 760 yards (15.5 average) and six touchdowns.",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-hockenson/3200484f-4342-2041-c442-6c874885b155
DK Metcalf,"DeKaylin Zecharius ""DK"" Metcalf decided to leave Ole Miss after his redshirt sophomore season to follow in the footsteps of his father, (former Ole Miss guard Terrance), grandfather (St. Louis Cardinals running back Terry) and uncle (Pro Bowl returner Eric). His final campaign with his hometown Rebels started off fine, catching 26 passes for 569 yards (21.9 average) and five scores in seven starts. However, he missed the rest of the season with a neck injury. Metcalf had already showed scouts quite a bit in those seven starts as well as in the 2017 season. He was a SEC All-Freshman pick that year, starting all 12 games and grabbing 39 passes for 646 yards (16.6 average) and seven touchdowns. Metcalf had intended on playing his true freshman season in 2016, but the four-star recruit broke his foot in the second game of the year. His two catches in those games went for only 13 yards but both were touchdowns. The injury bug hit him again in 2018, as he suffered a season-ending neck injury after looking like a superstar in the first seven games of the season (26-569-21.9, five TD).",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dk-metcalf/32004d45-5436-3377-5806-d2746f1b94aa
Kyler Murray,"Replacing a Heisman Trophy winner is a tall task, but Murray proved to be up to the challenge. He repeated Baker Mayfield's accomplishment in 2018, winning the same trophy after an outstanding junior season. The first-team Associated Press All-American and Player of the Year, Davey O'Brien Award winner, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and finalist for the Maxwell Award played in all 14 games with 13 starts (he did not start against Baylor because he was late for practice). He ranked in the top five nationally in passing efficiency (199.2), passing yardage (4,361), passing touchdowns (42, against just seven interceptions), and rushing yardage by a quarterback (123-1,001-7.3, 12 TD). He became the second quarterback in FBS history (Deshaun Watson, 2015) to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards. Murray signed with Texas A&M out of high school, following his dad's footsteps to play quarterback there (Kevin set many school passing records there in the mid 1980s). Kyler was a five-star recruit and top 50 overall prospect from Allen High School in Texas who went 43-0 as a starter, totaled 14,500 yards of offense, and won the National Gatorade Player of the Year after his senior year from multiple outlets. He played in eight games for the Aggies as a true freshman, making three starts (72-121-59.5, 686 yards, five TD, seven INT passing; 53-335-6.3 rushing). After the season, he joined fellow passer Kyle Allen in transferring out of a struggling Texas A&M program. He decided on Oklahoma, sitting out the 2016 season there as a redshirt. Murray played in seven games behind Mayfield in 2017, starting one contest (18-21-85.7, 359 yards, three TD, no INT). He was the ninth overall pick in the 2018 Major League Baseball amateur draft, selected by the Oakland A's, who presented him with about $5 million in signing bonus. Murray played outfield and hit cleanup for the Sooners' baseball team in 2017, batting .296 with 10 homers and 47 RBI. Murray's dad played minor league ball, as well, and his uncle, Calvin, played outfield in the majors.",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyler-murray/32004d55-5267-0413-8d36-a5c3fd781aa0
Ed Oliver,"Many people were surprised when Oliver became one of the first five-star recruits to sign with a non-Power Five conference program. The Cougars had signed his brother (Marcus, a two-year starter at right guard) and former high school coach, however, so E.J. (short for Ed Jr.) signed to play near his hometown of Westfield. He was a second-team All-American and top-5 overall recruit who eschewed Alabama to play for UH. He fulfilled his promise quickly, earning first-team All-American and all-conference honors as a true freshman, starting all 13 games and ranking second in the country with 23 tackles for loss, including 3.5 against San Diego State in the Las Vegas Bowl. He also was credited with five sacks among his 66 total tackles, as well as three forced fumbles and nine pass breakups. Oliver won the Outland Trophy and was a finalist for the Nagurski Award as a sophomore, also garnering consensus All-American honors and winning the American Athletic Conference's Defensive Player of the Year Award with 73 tackles, 16.5 for loss, 5.5 sacks, and three pass breakups despite facing constant double-teams. He struggled with a knee injury throughout his junior season and had a televised blow-out with third-year head coach Major Applewhite (who was fired after the season) over whether he should be wearing a heavy jacket on the sideline meant for suited players while nursing that injury. In the end, he started eight games (54 tackles, team-high 14.5 for loss, three sacks, two pass breakups) and earned second-team All-AAC honors and third-team All-American notice from the Associated Press. Oliver's father was a running back at Northwestern State in Louisiana with LSU head coach Ed Orgeron and NFL players Gary Reasons and Mark Duper.",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ed-oliver/32004f4c-4929-0385-df1c-0f8e40559b5a
Montez Sweat,"Shaquan Montez Sweat was a tight end recruit coming out of Stone Mountain, Ga., when he signed with Michigan State for the 2014 season. He moved to defense and played in two games that year (four tackles, 0.5 sack) but wound up taking a redshirt. Sweat played in two games in 2015, as well, but was suspended for the rest of the season for undisclosed reasons. He left East Lansing in the spring, enrolling at Copiah-Lincoln Junior College, where he was credited with 39 tackles and five sacks in his one season there. MSU came calling and Sweat accepted the Bulldogs' offer. All he did in his first season in Starkville was earn first-team All-SEC honors by leading the conference with 10.5 sacks (tied for eighth in the FBS). In 13 starts his junior year, ""Tez"" collected 48 total tackles, 15.5 for loss. He repeated his first-team All-SEC feat in 2018, also receiving second-team All-American notice from the Associated Press after compiling 53 tackles, 14 for loss, and a team-high 11.5 sacks.",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/montez-sweat/32005357-4503-4375-fdbc-389a73a5ddc5
Jawaan Taylor,"Taylor was highly-recruited out of Florida's Cocoa High School, but Florida coaches told him he needed to lose weight before they would offer him a scholarship. He went from 380 pounds to a listed 347 when signing his letter of intent with the Gators. That hard work paid off on the field, as he started 12 of 13 games played in his first year in Gainesville, garnering Freshman All-American honors and being named to the Freshman All-SEC team. He played in all 11 games as a sophomore, starting the first nine at right tackle and the final two on the left side. Taylor was considered one of the best linemen in the country by NFL scouts in 2018, even though his play in 12 games at right tackle did not garner him any all-conference honors. He sat out the opening series of the Gators' first game last fall because he did not ""meet the Gator standard.""",6.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jawaan-taylor/32005441-5934-9425-ed94-9fc450b432bc
Johnathan Abram,"Abram was his conference's Defensive Player of the Year at safety as a high school senior in Columbia, Miss., and also a dual-threat quarterback. He left the state to sign with Georgia for the 2015 season. Abram played well, starting four of 10 games played that year (25 tackles, 1.5 for loss) but he did not go to the team's bowl game because of ""personal issues."" Those issues, along with the departure of defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt to Alabama, led Abram to return to Mississippi to play at Jones County Junior College for 2016. The No. 1 JUCO safety recruit in the country, Abram enrolled at MSU to become a starter for the Bulldogs his junior year (71 tackles, five for loss, two sacks, five pass breakups). His play in 2017 earned fans of NFL scouts, and his senior campaign impressed SEC coaches (first-team all-conference) and the media (third-team Associated Press All-American).

Bradbury started all 13 games at left guard in 2016, and then earned honorable mention All-ACC honors as a junior as a 13-game starter in the pivot. He won the team's 2017 award for vital contribution in an unsung role.

The cousin of NFL star receiver Antonio Brown chose Oklahoma because of its wide-open attack, and he excelled with Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield, leading the Sooners with 1,095 yards and seven touchdowns on 57 catches (19.2 average). The honorable mention All-Big 12 selection did his part against Georgia in the national semifinal, catching eight passes for 114 yards and a score. He excelled in his junior season, receiving first-team All-Big 12 and first-team All-American notice from the Associated Press by catching 75 passes for 1,318 yards, averaging a hardy 17.6 yards per reception, and 10 touchdowns. His receiving yardage total ranked in the top 10 nationally.

He received death threats through social media and insults in person but stuck with his decision. Even when the Rebels were sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations, Brown stayed in Oxford with new coach Matt Luke. He played in in every game with one start as a true freshman (29-412-14.2, two TD).

His play against Clemson (4.5 tackles for loss, two sacks) got NFL scouts intrigued in his potential. Despite FSU's struggles in 2018, his play stood out enough that he earned first-team All-ACC notice from league coaches and media.

He played in eight games as a reserve his true freshman year at OSU, but had no catches or returns. That changed the following season, as Campbell started 12 of 13 games played (13-121-9.3 receiving; 4-54-13.5, one TD rushing) and was named third-team All-Big Ten as a kick returner (21-584-27.8).

Clelin Ferrell,"Though Ferrell was an all-state football star at Benedictine College Prep in Virginia, an all-male military school, he suffered through some difficult times. His father passed away when he was a freshman, and he missed his senior football season with a torn ACL. Ferrell was still ranked among the top 10 defensive end recruits in the country. Unfortunately, his bad luck continued once he arrived at Clemson, as a hand injury forced him to redshirt the 2015 season. Ferrell stood out as a freshman the following fall, sharing the team's defensive rookie of the year award with Dexter Lawrence after posting 50 tackles, 12.5 for loss, and six sacks in 15 starts. He made an impact in the ACC Championship Game (sack) and national semifinal (Fiesta Bowl Defensive MVP with three tackles for loss, sack) for the eventual title-winners. His sophomore season was even more impressive. Ferrell was named first-team All-American by the Associated Press, first-team All-ACC by league coaches and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award as the nation's top defensive end (63 tackles, 18 for loss, 9.5 sacks, two forced fumbles in 14 starts). Clemson coaches named him co-defensive player of the game (two tackles, sack) in the team's loss to Alabama in the national title game. The Tigers took care of business in 2018, beating Alabama thanks in part to Ferrell's All-American play.

He played in 12 games as a sophomore, starting four games at left guard when regular Ben Powers was out. Ford was moved from guard to right tackle for the 2018 season to replace Bobby Evans, who moved to left tackle after the departure of Orlando Brown to the NFL.

Dwayne Haskins,"Former Ohio State and NFL cornerback Shawn Springs mentored Haskins as a youth, convincing him to move from New Jersey to Maryland so he could play at the private Bullis School in Potomac. He was the Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior, received four-star rankings and was named one of the top five pro-style quarterbacks in the country. Haskins originally signed with Maryland before Randy Edsall was fired, then changing his mind to play for Urban Meyer -- a smart move, as it turns out.  He redshirted in 2015 while J.T.

Haskins stepped into the national spotlight in 2018, becoming the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year and leading the team to a Big Ten title. He was also a third-team All-American and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting, leading the nation with 4,831 passing yards and 50 touchdown passes (just eight interceptions) in 14 starts, and ranking in the top five in the FBS with a 70.0 percent completion rate (373-533).",6.7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dwayne-haskins/32004841-5328-5847-4bf1-f4c48a3a3bc6

Dexter Lawrence,"Clemson Defensive Coordinator Brett Venables has recruited many top-level talents, but Lawrence may have been the most heralded of them all. He was a top-five recruit nationally and was chased by every blue-blood program in the country after being named the North Carolina state Player of the Year by the Associated Press (91 tackles, 21 for loss, 13 sacks) at Wake Forest High School in North Carolina. It did not take Lawrence long to find the field as a freshman, starting 11 of 15 games to become a Freshman All-American by multiple outlets, ACC Defensive Freshman of the Year, and second-team all-conference after posting 79 tackles, 9.5 for loss, seven sacks, and two blocked kicks. He excelled during the team's national championship run, recording two sacks against Virginia Tech in the ACC Championship Game and four tackles against Alabama in the title game. While his snaps (438 vs. 643 as a freshman) and statistical production (39 tackles, three for loss, 2.5 sacks) were down in 2017, ACC coaches still voted Lawrence first-team all-conference. Lawrence was first-team All-ACC again as a junior, starting 13 games for the Tigers (44 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, three pass breakups). He missed the team's two playoff appearances, however, after testing positive for ostarine, a performance-enhancing drug. Lawrence maintained that he did not knowingly ingest the substance.",6.7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dexter-lawrence/32004c41-5728-8048-d62b-e09e0d1d71d6
Erik McCoy,"McCoy was not highly recruited despite earning second-team all-state honors at Lufkin High School in Texas. Aggies coaches saw enough to give him a scholarship, however, and he worked himself into a three-year starter. He redshirted in 2015 before earning the starting center spot for all 13 contests in 2016. McCoy started all 13 games for A&M in 2017, as well, 11 at center and two at guard. He was a team captain in 2018, again starting all 13 games in the middle of the offensive line called the ""Maroon Goons.""",6.7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/erik-mccoy/32004d43-4360-1333-481d-eca6355623f4
Dalton Risner,"Risner was a communications major at KSU and has already proved himself ready to use these skills to have a worldwide impact by creating social media presence as part of his Rise Up Foundation. The two-time All-State pick from Colorado earned the starting job at center for all 13 games of his redshirt freshman year. He moved to right tackle for the 2016 season and garnered first-team All-Big 12 notice for his play as a 12-game starter. He again was a first-team pick in 2017 after starting 12 games at right tackle, though Risner missed the team's bowl game to have surgery on his left shoulder to make sure it was ready for his senior season. His play in 2018 did not suffer due to that malady, as he was named a second-team Associated Press All-American for his play in 12 starts at right tackle. He was named one of three Offensive Linemen of the Year and first-team all-conference.",6.7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dalton-risner/32005249-5344-7993-8f0d-2bff7b149b04
Jerry Tillery,"Rated as one of the top offensive linemen in the country coming out of Shreveport's Evangel Christian Academy, Tillery was switched to defense as a true freshman. He started 3 of 12 games that year (12 tackles, two for loss) but was suspended for the Fiesta Bowl for violating team rules. Tillery's sophomore year was productive (37 tackles, three for loss in 12 games, 11 starts) but again he had issues, shown by television cameras to be kicking and stepping on players in the team's loss to USC. Things smoothed out his junior year, as he started all 13 games and became one of the top defensive tackles in the country (56 tackles, nine for loss, 4.5 sacks). Tillery received more respect nationally in 2018, garnering second-team All-American status from the Associated Press as he wreaked havoc against his opponents (30 tackles, 10.5 for loss, eight sacks, three forced fumble, two blocked kicks in 13 starts).",6.7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerry-tillery/32005449-4c18-9606-c437-604f05433c81
Devin White,"White's prowess on offense (5,031 yards, 81 touchdowns in his career) and defense (192 tackles) during his time at North Webster (Louisiana) High School earned him four-star ratings and a spot on the Baton Rouge Advocate's Super Dozen recruit list for 2016. He earned playing time as a true freshman, suiting up for all 12 games and posting 30 tackles, three for loss. The SEC All-Freshman squad selection's only sack of the year came against Louisville's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Lamar Jackson. White became the star everyone thought he would in 2017, leading the SEC with 133 tackles and topping the Tigers with 14 tackles for loss (4.5 sacks) in 13 starts to earn a permanent team captaincy and MVP award as well as first-team all-conference and second-team USA Today All-American honors. He met high expectations again as a junior, garnering first-team All-SEC pick and Associated Press All-American accolades and winning the Butkus Award as the top linebacker in the country after starting 12 of 13 games played (he missed the first half of LSU's 2018 loss to Alabama due to a questionable targeting call made during the team's win over Mississippi State). White led the Tigers with 123 stops, 12 of which went for losses including three sacks, six pass breakups, and three forced fumbles.",6.7,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devin-white/32005748-4939-9982-dafe-8aace4ba0d48
Christian Wilkins,"Not only is Wilkins a star defensive lineman for the Tigers, but he was also the first scholarship Clemson football player to earn a degree in just two and a half years. His work in the classroom, in the community and on the field earned him the prestigious William V. Campbell Trophy after his senior season. Wilkins was also a first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-ACC selection for his play (57 tackles, 15 for loss, six sacks, two forced fumbles), which helped the Tigers win their second national title since he arrived on campus. The top 25 national recruit broke out in a big way his freshman year, earning Freshman All-American honors by racking up 84 tackles, 4.5 for loss, and two sacks in 15 games. Wilkins had 10 tackles in 35 snaps against Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl that season. In the team's 2016 national championship season, he was a third-team Associated Press All-American and second-teams All-ACC selection, starting all 15 games and compiling 56 stops, 13 for loss, and 3.5 sacks. He also set a school record for  defensive linemen with 10 pass breakups. Wilkins was a permanent team captain in 2017, starting all 14 games, making 53 tackles (8.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks) playing primarily inside after spending time at defensive end in previous seasons. His grandfather, Eurie Stamps, was killed when a SWAT team rifle accidentally discharged during a raid of his apartment in January 2011.

Quinnen Williams,"The depth of Alabama's defensive line never ceases to amaze. Williams was the next breakout star for the Tide up front in 2018, becoming a household name for college football fans and earning finalist honors for the Bronko Nagurski and Bednarik Awards and the Outland Trophy. The Associated Press first-team All-American and first-team All-SEC selection started 15 times as a sophomore, leading the Tide with 18.5 tackles for loss among his 70 total stops (also posting seven sacks and a safety). The four-star recruit and top-200 prospect nationally redshirted in 2016 while learning from stars like Johnathan Allen and Da'Ron Payne. The Birmingham native played in all 14 games as a freshman the following fall (20 tackles, 6.5 for loss, two sacks). Williams' brother, Quincy Jr., was a first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference linebacker at Murray State this fall (111 tackles, 78 solo, 9.5 for loss, two interceptions).

Jonah Williams,"A five-star recruit, Williams' work ethic and athleticism made him one of the most coveted high school players in the country after he finished his career at Folsom High School in California. Williams actually left Folsom early, enrolling at Alabama in January 2016 to get a jump start.  The move paid off, as Williams earned the starting right tackle spot for all 15 games that season, as well as Freshman All-American honors and a spot on the SEC All-Freshman squad. Williams moved to the left tackle spot in 2017, taking over for Cam Robinson as the starter for all 14 games and receiving third-team All-American notice from the Associated Press and a first-team All-SEC nod in the Tide's national championship season. In 2018, he earned AP first-team All-American recognition. He was highly-decorated again after starting all 15 times at left tackle in 2018, earning a spot as a Outland Trophy finalist, receiving unanimous first-team All-American notice and repeating as a first-team All-SEC selection.

Greedy Williams,"Andraez ""Greedy"" Williams was given his nickname by his grandmother when he was young. Opposing quarterbacks do not disagree with that label, as he attacks the ball as if it was his alone. Williams helped Shreveport's Calvary Academy win state titles in 2013 and 2014 and secured all-state honors as a senior while receiving four-star recruiting grades. Williams also played youth football with another LSU star, linebacker Devin White. He redshirted his first year in Baton Rouge due to the team's depth at corner. When starter Kevin Tolliver was suspended for the 2017 season opener, Williams took advantage by intercepting a pass. He continued to start in every game that season, posting 38 tackles and leading the SEC with six picks and 1.3 passes defended per game (11 pass breakups). SEC coaches rightfully named him first-team all-conference for his efforts, and the Associated Press tabbed him third-team All-American. Williams was a first-team all-conference selection again in 2018, as well as an Associated Press second-team All-American after starting 12 games, posting 33 tackles, two interceptions, and nine pass breakups. He chose not to play in the team's bowl game to prepare for the draft.

He was a second-team All-SEC selection his junior year, starting 14 of 15 games played, making 44 tackles, intercepting three passes, and breaking up nine more. One of those interceptions came against Alabama in the national championship game. As a sophomore, he announced himself a pro prospect by picking off two passes and breaking up five others while starting 7 of 12 games played (31 tackles, one sack).

Noah Fant,"Thought Fant was a two-time All-Nebraska selection and school record-holder for receptions for Omaha South High School, he decided the University of Iowa would be his best fit. He wanted to be the next Hawkeye tight end to make it to the NFL, and also has interest in becoming an orthopedic surgeon after his playing days are done. Fant is surgical about his ability to beat defenses and showed glimpses of that talent in his true freshman 2016 season (9-70-7.8, one TD in 11 games as a reserve). Coaches got him involved in the offense more regularly in 2017. He responded by earning third-team All-Big Ten accolades after catching 30 passes for 494 yards (16.5 average) and 11 touchdowns, including one in his team's win over Boston College in the Pinstripe Bowl. Fant increased his production as a junior (39-519-13.3, seven TD) to garner first-team All-Big Ten notice and third-team All-American honors from the Associated Press.

As a sophomore, Gardner-Johnson started all 11 games for the Gators, posting 58 stops, six for loss, two interceptions and seven pass breakups. In 2016, Gardner-Johnson started as a reserve defensive back and special teams contributor (team-high eight of his 32 tackles that year on coverage units), but eventually started three times in 13 games played. He tied for the team lead with three interceptions, two of which came in the Outback Bowl. He was the game's MVP, becoming the first freshman to win that honor at Florida since Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith.

Drew Lock,"Lock could have gone anywhere to lead a college offense as an Elite 11 camp participant and the Kansas City Metro Player of the Year as a senior. Lock decided to move back to his birthplace of Columbia to play college ball, partially because there seemed a good chance he would play right away. That scenario played out, as Lock started the final eight games (played in 12 total) as a freshman, throwing for 1,332 yards, four touchdowns, and eight interceptions (129-263, 49.1 completion pct.). His play improved in his sophomore season, completing 54.6 percent of his passes (237-434) for a SEC-high 3,399 yards, which also ranked tenth in the FBS that year. He threw for 23 touchdowns that year, having just 10 passes intercepted. His strong arm helped him lead the FBS with 44 passing touchdowns in 2017, as well as lead his team to six straight wins at the end of the year to reach a bowl game. He also completed 57.8 percent of his throws (242-519) for 3,964 yards and 13 interceptions. Lock garnered second-team All-SEC honors in 2018 despite throwing for fewer yards (3,498) and touchdowns (28) in his senior season.

Byron Murphy,"In a rare feat, Murphy was an All-American high school receiver (88-1,733, 21 TDs) at Saguaro High in the Phoenix area, and also a finalist for an award for the top defensive back in high school football (seven INTs). The top 100 national recruit signed with UW to play cornerback, redshirting his first year on campus and winning the team's Defensive Scout Player of the Year for his work at practice. His freshman year began and ended with three starts, but he lost seven midseason games to a broken foot suffered in practice. He played well in a return to Arizona that year, making seven tackles, two for loss, a sack, and an interception against Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl. Murphy's sophomore season met high expectations, as he earned first-team All-Pac-12 and second-team Associated Press All-American accolades. In 13 starts, he collected 58 tackles, four for loss, and led the team with four interceptions (one returned for a score) and 13 pass deflections.

Deebo Samuel,"Tyshun ""Deebo"" Samuel received his nickname because he often bullied other kids growing up. That sort of attitude has proven to be a good thing on the field, especially when he starred for USC in 2018. He earned first-team All-SEC honors as an all-purpose player and return specialist (23-570-24.8, TD on kickoffs) and was also named a second-team all-conference receiver (62-882-14.2, 11 TD). He started 11 of 12 games played but chose not to participate in his team's bowl game in order to prepare for the draft. Samuel was off to a hot start the first three games of 2017, being a factor as a receiver (15-250-16.7, three TD), rusher (2-30-15.0) and returner (both kickoff returns went for touchdowns) before breaking his leg. The South Carolina native had shared the team's Most Valuable Player award after the 2016 season with quarterback Jake Bentley, leading the Gamecocks with 59 receptions for 783 yards (13.3 average) and one touchdown in 10 starts. Samuel also scored as a kick returner (16-431-26.9), though he missed three games with a hamstring injury.

Daniel Jones,"Coach David Cutcliffe has done an excellent job bringing Duke football back to relevance, but NFL scouts are most interested in the work he's done with Jones, helping the Charlotte native reach his potential as he did Peyton and Eli Manning while coaching at Tennessee and Ole Miss, respectively. Jones has a similar build to the Mannings but his superior athleticism was evident at Charlotte Latin High School, where he was a record-setting two-time all-state pick in football and a three-year basketball player. In fact, that athleticism runs in the family, as his brother plays basketball at Davidson and his sister played field hockey at that school, as well. Jones stepped into the spotlight at Duke as a redshirt freshman in 2016, starting all 12 games. The team's Most Valuable Player completed 63.8 percent of his throws for 2,836 yards, 16 touchdowns, and nine interceptions while also producing with his feet (141-486-3.5, seven TD). His numbers dipped a bit in his sophomore campaign (257-453-56.7, 2,691 yards, 14 TD, 11 INT, 161-518-3.2, seven TD), but he finished on a strong note by earning Quick Lane Bowl MVP honors (27-40, 252 yards, two TD) in his team's win over Northern Illinois. Jones started 11 games in 2018, missing two with a broken clavicle. He completed 60.5 percent of his passes (237-392) for 2,674 yards, 22 touchdowns, and nine interceptions on the year while rushing for 319 yards and three scores. He again starred in the team's bowl game, throwing for 423 yards and five touchdowns (with two interceptions) in their win over Temple.",6.3,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daniel-jones/32004a4f-4e16-5462-39a4-3b4fa743c66f
Justin Layne,"Layne was an All-Ohio receiver as a senior (46-790-17.2, 11 TDs) at Benedictine High School in Cleveland before signing with Michigan State. He began his career at MSU as a receiver, but the Spartans' coaches moved him from offense to defense midway through his true freshman season. He wound up starting five of the team's final seven games that year, posting 18 tackles, 1.5 for loss, an interception (that he returned for a score), and a pass breakup. Layne became a full-time starter in 2017, garnering honorable mention All-Big Ten honors by compiling 40 tackles, intercepting one pass and breaking up eight others. He was a second-team all-conference pick as a junior, starting 12 games and making 72 tackles, 2.5 for loss. He also intercepted one pass, and ranked in the top 10 in the FBS with 15 pass breakups.

He also played in the NFL for three years. The younger Chris' uncle, Eric, played at BC, and his younger brother, Alex, is his teammate on the offensive line. Lindstrom stepped into the starting lineup at right guard for the final nine games of his true freshman season, playing in 12 contests. He started at right guard for all 13 games in 2016 before earning second-team All-ACC honors as a junior, splitting time between right guard (two starts) and right tackle (11 starts). He stuck at right guard for all 12 games in 2018, earning Associated Press third-team All-American and first-team All-ACC notice.",6.3,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-lindstrom/32004c49-4e45-1080-da0b-72312551b1b2

Little was a top five recruit regardless of position in 2016 and a second-team All-American after his senior season at Allen, which won a mythical national title in 2014. He was a Freshman All-American and SEC All-Freshman squad honoree in his first year on campus, playing in all 12 games and starting the final five games at left tackle. League coaches voted him second-team All-SEC after 12 starts at left tackle in 2017.

Julian Love,"Love grew up in the Chicago area, attending Notre Dame football games as a child with his father. At Nazareth Academy, he was a force on offense (104-1,067-10.3, 18 TD rushing; 29-662-22.8, 7 TD receiving) and defense (92 tackles, 15 for loss) for a team that won state titles his junior and senior seasons. It was a natural fit for him to sign with the Irish, who placed him into the starting line-up for the last eight games of his true freshman season (45 tackles, two for loss, one interceptions, three pass breakups in 12 games played). Love started all 13 games in 2017, ranked second in the FBS that year with a school-record 20 pass breakups. He was also credited with 68 tackles and three interceptions on the year, returning two of those picks for touchdowns (vs. Michigan State, N.C. State). Love was a finalist for the Thorpe Award in 2018 and an Associated Press first-team All-American after ranking in the top 10 nationally with 16 pass breakups. He totaled 63 stops, three for loss, one interception, and three fumble recoveries in 13 starts as a junior.

Kaleb McGary,"McGary was a conference defensive player of the year and first-team all-conference tight end at Fife (Washington) High School before heading to the Huskies. He redshirted his first year, then took over the starting right tackle job in six of 12 games in 2015. McGary started all 14 games there as a sophomore and earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors on the right side as a 13-game starter in 2017. He was again a first-team all-conference performer at right tackle as a senior, starting all 14 games for the Pac-12 champions. He and his family have been through serious adversity. Kaleb was diagnosed with a heart arrthymia, and his father with multiple sclerosis. The family was forced off the family farm when he was in high school.

Christian Miller,"Miller was a five-star prospect and top-five linebacker recruit nationally coming out of Columbia, S.C., in 2014. The son of former NFL veteran linebacker Corey Miller was a Parade All-American and finalist for South Carolina's Mr. Football award as a senior. His career at Alabama has not been as productive as he would have hoped. Miller waited his turn for three seasons in the Tide's deep linebacking corps, redshirting in 2014, playing in 12 games as a reserve the following year, and securing 16 tackles (2.5 for loss, two sacks) in 15 games as a sophomore. He suffered a biceps injury in the 2017 season opener, missing 10 games but returned to play in four contests overall (six tackles, two for loss, sack). Miller only lined up with the starters in 4 of 14 games played in 2018 but was a regular contributor on defense in every contest (36 tackles, 11.5 for loss, 8.5 sacks, one pass breakup).

David Montgomery,"Montgomery was a dual-threat quarterback in high school, even earning Division III Ohio Player of the Year recognition from the Associated Press after his senior season (2,707 yards, 41 TD rushing). Schools outside the Midwest did not come calling, however, so Iowa State nabbed the three-star recruit. He led the Cyclones in rushing as a true freshman, playing in all 12 games with starts in the final four weeks (109-563-5.2, two TDs rushing; 13-129-9.9 receiving). Montgomery had more of a workload in 2017, starting all 13 games and earning first-team All-Big 12 notice with 258 carries for 1,146 yards (4.4 average) and 11 scores. He also helped carry the passing offense with 36 receptions for 296 yards (8.2 average). Montgomery was a second-team all-conference pick by the coaches his junior season, accumulating 257 carries for 1,216 yards (4.7 average) and 13 touchdowns (also 22-157-7.1 receiving) in 12 games (11 starts).",6.3,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-montgomery/32004d4f-4e48-7374-a044-7fb197b6b501
Trayvon Mullen,"The first cousin of former Heisman Trophy-winner at Louisville and current Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson decided to join his relative in the NFL instead of returning to Clemson for his senior season. Mullen was named second-team All-American by USA Today and was a top 100 overall prospect nationally out of Fort Lauderdale, starring as a receiver his senior year. He played as a reserve defensive back and on special teams coverage units as a freshman in 2016 (15 tackles, one pass breakup). Mullen started 12 of 13 games played the following season, receiving honorable mention All-ACC accolades for his play (42 tackles, three interceptions, seven pass breakups). He was a second-team all-conference pick in 2018, starting 14 of 15 games played for the national champions. Mullen posted 37 stops, four for loss, an interception and four pass breakups as a junior, finishing the year as the title game Defensive MVP with 6 tackles, a sack, an interception and a forced fumble to help shut down Alabama's offense in the second half.",6.3,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trayvon-mullen/32004d55-4c38-0585-7ea5-54b5f4d9dbd8
Taylor Rapp,"Rapp's family has Chinese ancestry, but he is a dual citizen between the United States and Canada. He promised his brother, Austin, that he would play major college football -- a promise that has been fulfilled. He was an All-Washington pick from Bellingham that earned top 25 safety recruit grades from scouting services. Rapp broke his left hand in spring practices his freshman year, but played with a cast. That toughness impressed on coaches his willingness to fight through adversity, and he eventually won a starting role on defense in 10 of 14 games played in 2016 (53 tackles, four interceptions, two pass breakups). Rapp was the Pac-12 Championship Defensive MVP after intercepting two passes in the contest, returning one for a score. He also was named the Pac-12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year and a Freshman All-American for his efforts throughout the season. He started 12 of 13 games played as a sophomore, garnering first-team All-Pac-12 honors (in academics as well as on the field) and posting 59 stops, 3.5 for loss, two sacks, and an interception. Multiple All-American honors came his way in 2018, as did another first-team all-conference nod after he made plays around the line of scrimmage (59 tackles, six for loss, five sacks) and in coverage (two interceptions, five pass breakups while also finding himself around the ball (three fumble recoveries).",6.3,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taylor-rapp/32005241-5050-5098-ef4c-235f382d663d
Riley Ridley,"Cavin Riley Ridley is the younger brother of former Alabama star and 2018 first-round pick Calvin Ridley.

Ridley contributed as a seven-game starter as a sophomore (14-218-15.6, two TD), stepping up in the national championship game with six catches for 82 yards. And while he did not produce a ton of offense in 2016, he showed enough as a freshman (12-238-19.8, two TD) to portend his future success.",6.3,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/riley-ridley/32005249-4465-5571-9152-169716f4ce38
Miles Sanders,"Expectations for Sanders were sky-high when he signed with his home-state Nittany Lions. He was a top-25 overall prospect nationally after winning Pennsylvania's Mr. Football award in 2015 and running for over 4,500 yards during his career at Woodland Hills High School in Pittsburgh. The presence of All-American Saquon Barkley on the squad stunted Sanders' growth, though he did manage to get on the field in 13 games as a true freshman in 2016, primarily on special teams (33 returns, 688 yards, 20.8 average on kick returns; 25 carries, 184 yards, 7.4 average, one touchdown rushing; 2 catches, 14 yards, 12.0 average, one touchdown receiving).

With Barkley off to the NFL in 2018, Sanders took full advantage by running for 1,274 yards and nine scores on 220 carries (5.8 average).

Warring redshirted the 2015 season while bulking up, and then played in four games as a reserve (2-17-8.5, two touchdowns) the following year before a broken foot cut the year short. Coaches gave him a scholarship before the 2017 season, and he ended up starting 3 of 13 games played (18-248-13.8, three TD). Warring only started twice in 12 games played in 2018 but was still named honorable mention All-Mountain West because he led the Aztecs with 31 receptions (which went for 372 yards, 12.0 average, and three scores).

He played in three games in 2015 but redshirted with an ankle injury (46-70-65.7, 485 yards, one TD, four INT). Impressively, he earned his degree in just three years at BSU so he decided to transfer as Brett Rypien had taken the starting spot. Finley more than met expectations at N.C. State in 2016, starting all 13 games (243-402-60.4, 3,059 yards, 18 TD, eight INT). He took his game up a notch in 2017, becoming a Johnny Unitas Award finalist and third-team All-ACC pick.

Hardman provided excitement on special teams, as he ranked eighth in the FBS on punt-return average (23-271-11.8) and also excelled on kickoff returns (20-505-25.3). He scored both of the Bulldogs' touchdowns against Alabama in the national championship game. He continued to make plays as a receiver (34-532-15.6, seven TD receiving; 5-36-7.2 rushing in 14 games with five starts) and on special teams as a junior, garnering second-team All-SEC notice for his returns (16-321-20.1, one TD on punts; 14-353-25.2 on kickoffs).

As a true freshman, Harris made an impact as a rusher (46-157, one TD), receiver (4-13), and kick returner (9-174). With Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry leaving for the NFL, Harris held off challenges from talented young players to become the team's bellcow back in 2016. He led Alabama with 1,037 yards (146 carries, 7.1-yard average) as a sophomore despite playing through a leg injury midway through the year. SEC coaches failed to name him all-conference after the 2017 season, even though his 1,000 rushing yards and 11 scores came on just 135 carries (no fumbles) and he ranked seventh in the FBS with 7.4 yards per attempt.

As a true freshman at Tennessee, Hurd led the Volunteers in rushing (190-899-4.7, 5 TDs) and also contributed as a receiver (35-221-6.3, 2 TDs) while starting 9 of 13 games played. He made an impact in his first bowl game, rushing for 122 yards and two scores against Iowa in the TaxSlayer.com Bowl.

Things began to change in 2016 when Hurd started the first seven games of the year (112-4541-3.7, three TD) but suffered a concussion. He approached his coaches about a position change due to the head injury, and when they declined to move him, Hurd decided to transfer. Baylor accepted him into the fold in 2017, and he sat out the year while learning the wideout position. Coaches used him as a running back on occasion (48-209-4.4, three TD) during his senior season, but he won the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year award because he led the Bears in receiving (69-946-13.7, four TDs) while starting 11 of 12 games played.

Johnson was a first-team all-conference punt returner (13-241-18.5) and second-team kickoff returner (16-412-25.8), as well. He earned the same all-conference accolades as a sophomore, leading the Golden Rockets in receiving (74,1,278-17.3, 13 TDs) while scoring on both types of returns (4-102-25.5, one TD punt return; 30-683-22.8, one TD kickoff return). Johnson contributed in 11 games as a reserve his true freshman season (14-237-16.9, three TD receiving; 33-754-22.8 kick returns), but lost the 2016 season due to a lower-body injury.

Wren began disrupting plays more regularly as a 13-game starter in 2018, posting 43 tackles, 4.5 for loss, one sack, and two pass breakups to earn honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors.",6.2,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/renell-wren/32005752-4542-2041-ca80-11bac75769dc
Oshane Ximines,"Ximines (pronounced zim-ah-nes) has been a force on the field for the Monarchs since his redshirt freshman season, leading the team in tackles for loss and sacks in each season. The North Carolina native started all 12 games in 2015 (32 tackles, 7.5 for loss, five sacks, four pass breakups). Ximines started 12 of 13 games in 2016, but only because he took a backseat to a senior on Senior Day. He had 42 stops, 11.5 for loss, 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles that year. C-USA coaches finally recognized his play in 2017, voting him first-team all-conference after he racked up 44 tackles, 14 for loss, and a school-record 8.5 sacks. He forced four fumbles as a junior, which tied for second-most in the FBS. He ranked in the top 10 nationally in that category again in 2018, forcing four additional fumbles, while also finishing among the top players in the FBS with 18.5 tackles for loss and 12 sacks. The first-team all-conference  selection started all 12 games as a senior.",6.2,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/oshane-ximines/32005849-4d30-8281-ff5a-2f0f08abb7f2
Rodney Anderson,"Anderson showed great talent during his time with the Sooners but could not finish a season due to injuries. He broke his leg in the second game of the 2015 season, running the ball just once for 5 yards. In the spring of 2016, he suffered a fractured vertebra, missing the upcoming season. Anderson was healthy throughout his redshirt sophomore campaign, ending the year strong by leading the FBS in yards from scrimmage over the final seven weeks (all starts). He ran for 1,161 yards and 13 touchdowns on 188 carries (6.2 average) and caught 17 passes for 281 yards (16.5 average) and five more scores in 14 games, garnering second-team All-Big 12 honors. His 26 carries for 201 yards and two touchdowns against Clemson in the national semi-finals caused scouts to expect a big 2018 from the Katy, Texas native. However, Anderson again fell to injury in the second game of the year, this time his right knee gave out after he rushed 11 times for 119 yards and three scores over those two contests.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rodney-anderson/3200414e-4447-1841-e43a-8a52ce91e342
Ryquell Armstead,"Armstead did not start many games for the Owls over his first three seasons but produced when given his opportunities. He played in all 13 games as a true freshman (51-191-3.7, two TD rushing) and did so again in 2016, starting four games and nearly reaching 1,000 rushing yards and scoring 14 times (156-919-5.9). Armstead started 4 of 13 games played again in 2017, though his numbers dropped as a rusher (156-604-3.9, five TD). He also caught 14 passes for 75 yards (5.4 average) on the year. Nagging injuries hit him again during his senior season, but he still managed to garner first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors by gaining 1,098 yards and 13 touchdowns on 210 carries (5.2 average) in 10 starts. Armstead sat out Temple's bowl game in December to nurse an ankle injury and prepare for the NFL Draft.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryquell-armstead/32004152-4d08-7415-19ec-70f8e3f1c566
Corey Ballentine,"A two-sport star at Shawnee Heights High School in Topeka, Kansas, Ballentine flew under the radar a bit because he played football for just two seasons. However, he helped the track team's relay teams pick up a second-place finish at state as a junior (4x400) and a state title (4x100) his senior year. That athleticism has showed up during his career with the Icabods. He played in 11 games as a redshirt freshman (17 tackles) and then earned six starts in 12 games and honorable mention All-MIAA honors in 2016 (65 tackles, with a team-high 10 on special teams and 6.5 for loss, two interceptions, five pass breakups). MIAA coaches named him first-team all-conference in 2017, as the 12-game starter posted 54 tackles and seven pass breakups on the year.  He also ranked fifth in Division II by averaging 30.6 yards per kick return (23-703). Ballentine had less success returning kicks in 2018 (24-463-19.8), but he was a terror on special teams with three blocked kicks and was still a first-team all-conference defender (50 tackles, three for loss, three INT, four PBU, two forced fumbles). He ran track for Washburn as well, and had a fifth-place finish in the 100-meter dash at the 2016 Kansas Relays.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/corey-ballentine/32004241-4c69-2329-7f6f-1def422cc400

The first-team All-State tight end/defensive end redshirted his first year in Madison to bulk up, and then missed the first five games of the 2015 season with an injury suffered in fall camp. Benzschawel started the final eight games of that year, six at right tackle and two at right guard. He worked his way into a second-team All-Big Ten performance in 2016 as a 14-game starter at right guard, and then garnered third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten honors as a junior after starting all 14 games to the right of the center.

Kris Boyd,"Defensive back skills run in Boyd's family. His cousin, Curtis Brown, was an All-Big 12 defensive back for Texas. Another cousin, Bobby Taylor, was a defensive back at Notre Dame and an NFL Pro Bowler. Kris' brother, Demarco, must have not gotten the memo, as he suits up as a linebacker for the Longhorns. The top-10 cornerback prospect nationally and All-State pick from Gilmer, Texas stepped in to play in all 12 games as a reserve and on special teams in 2015 (16 tackles). Boyd moved into the starting line-up for the final eight games of his sophomore season, making 51 tackles, 1.5 for loss, intercepting one pass, and breaking up five others. In his junior campaign, Boyd started 12 of 13 games and collected 57 stops, two interceptions, and a team-high 15 pass breakups. He finished his career with the Longhorns in a flourish, receiving a first-team All-Big 12 nod after starting 13 of 14 games played and posting 67 tackles, 4.5 for loss, an interception, and 16 pass breakups (which tied for sixth-most in the FBS).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kris-boyd/3200424f-5922-9979-6eee-45a0ed047330
Jordan Brown,"Brown came to SDSU as a wide receiver after earning All-Arizona honors at the position as a junior and senior. He split time between receiver and cornerback, however, during his 2014 redshirt season. Coaches stuck him on defense the following year in 11 games (one start, seven tackles, three pass breakups), and then he became a stalwart in the secondary in 2016 (13 starts, 40 tackles, two interceptions, three pass breakups). Missouri Valley Football Conference coaches named him first-team all-league in 2017 after he led the Jackrabbits with nine pass breakups and three forced fumbles, in addition to 72 tackles, three for loss, and three interceptions. Brown was a first-team all-conference pick again in 2018 while also garnering third-team All-American honors from the Associated Press.

Yodny Cajuste,"The Miami Herald ranked Cajuste the 16th-best recruit in Dade-Broward Counties out of Mirimar High School, but he ended up flying north to Morgantown for college. He redshirted his first year, and then started the first six games of the 2015 season at left tackle before missing the rest of the regular season with a knee injury (returned as a reserve for the Cactus Bowl). Another knee injury ended his 2016 after just one start at left tackle. Cajuste stayed healthy throughout his junior year, garnering second-team All-Big 12 honors after starting all 13 games on the blind side. He shared the Big 12 Offensive Lineman of the Year award with two other draft prospects (Kansas State's Dalton Risner, Oklahoma's Dru Samia) in 2018, starting 11 games at left tackle for the Mountaineers.

He redshirted in 2014 and then earned a start at right guard in the Bulldogs' 2015 bowl game after playing in the first 12 games as a reserve. He started nine games on the right side in 2016, missing four with an ankle injury, and then lined up for all 13 games at right guard with the ones as a junior.

Coney earned a starting spot the following fall in nine of 12 games played, making 62 tackles, 1.5 for loss. Coney, a philosophy major, led the Irish with 116 tackles in 2017, 13 going for losses and three sacks. He started all 13 games for the Irish in 2018, garnering Associated Press third-team All-American honors by leading the team with 123 tackles and posting 9.5 tackles for loss, four sacks, one interception, and four pass breakups.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/te-von-coney/3200434f-4e14-7424-def9-e947684719e2

He had started across from Brown at right tackle in all 14 games as a sophomore, garnering honorable mention All-Big 12 notice. He was also an honorable mention all-conference pick his redshirt freshman campaign, starting the team's final 12 games at right tackle. Evans was a four-star recruit at Allen (Texas) High School, ranking among the top 100 overall prospects and top 10 offensive linemen.

He walked on to ODU with only two years' playing experience in high school and worked his way into a scholarship quickly. Fulgham contributed as a redshirt freshman (6-89-8.9) and then started all 13 games in 2016 (29-478-16.5, eight TD). His game took a step back in 2017 (30-394-13.1, one TD) with only seven starts in 12 appearances. Fulgham formed a strong duo with Jonathan Duhart in 2018, joining his teammate on the second-team All-Conference USA squad and leading the conference with 1,083 receiving yards (63 receptions, 17.2 average) and scoring nine times in 12 games (eight starts) for the Monarchs.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-fulgham/32004655-4c11-9395-5f24-196b3c9defed

Harmon became a productive player his first year in Raleigh, winning the team's Philip Rivers Award for the top freshman in the program, starting four games and leading the team with five touchdown receptions (27-462-17.1). He became the first Wolfpack receiver to eclipse 1,000 yards since 2003 his sophomore season, becoming a second-team All-ACC selection by catching a team-high 69 throws for 1,017 yards and four scores. Harmon's best game that season came against Clemson, when he torched the Tigers for 155 yards and a touchdown on eight catches. He became a first-team All-ACC selection as a junior, leading his team with 1,186 receiving yards and seven touchdowns on 81 catches (14.6 average) in 12 starts.

He stepped up to second-team all-conference notice in his senior season, starting all 13 games at his left guard spot.

Ka'dar Hollman,"Hollman could not land a scholarship offer after playing his high school ball in New Jersey and then playing at Milford Academy, a well-known prep school in New York. Toledo took a shot on his talent, offering him a preferred walk-on spot. He redshirted in 2014 and played in just two games the following year, making two tackles. The coaches gave him a scholarship prior to his sophomore season and he responded by starting 8 of 13 games (33 tackles, eight pass breakups). Hollman started all 14 games in 2017 (35 tackles, seven pass breakups) and completed his career with the Golden Rockets by leading the MAC with 12 pass breakups (to go along with 43 tackles and an interception).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ka-dar-hollman/3200484f-4c29-3436-625f-6710e1d10425
Andy Isabella,"Isabella's small stature kept him off the recruiting radar despite his success as a running back in Mayfield, Ohio. He was also a track star, winning the 100-meter dash at the state track meet as a senior and running a national-best 6.72 seconds in the 60-meter dash (he defeated Denzel Ward in the 100 and 200 events). His only FBS offer came from UMass, and he was primarily a special teams contributor as a true freshman, starting one of 10 games, catching just two passes for 7 yards, and returning kickoffs (17-315-18.5). Coaches got smart and put him in the starting lineup 10 times in 12 games in 2016, and he flourished (62-801-12.9, seven TD). Isabella became an even bigger threat as a junior, starting all 12 games and covering 1,020 yards and scoring 10 times on 65 receptions. He also contributed as a returner (5-114-22.8 on kickoffs, 2-22-11.0 on punts). If NFL scouts weren't interested in his game at that point, his senior season probably changed their minds. The Biletnikoff Award finalist as the nation's top receiver and second-team AP All-American led the FBS with 141.5 receiving yards per game (1,698, 16.7 per catch) and ranked near the top with 102 receptions and 13 touchdowns in 12 starts.

He led the team with 20.0 yards per reception as a senior (35-701), scoring 11 times in 14 starts while also making an impact on special teams units (two tackles).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terry-mclaurin/32004d43-4c27-8328-8097-b130ba0e8060
Shareef Miller,"Miller's brother (and role model) was shot and killed in May 2015 during an argument in West Philadelphia. It was a difficult time for Miller but he enrolled at Penn State and redshirted the 2015 season. The two-time first-team All-Southeastern Pennsylvania pick played in 14 games in 2016, regularly flashing potential (22 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two sacks). Miller was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection in 2017, playing in all 13 games with 12 starts and racking up 37 tackles, 11 for loss, and five sacks. He honored an injured teammate by wearing the No. 19 jersey in two September matchups. Miller was a third-team all-conference pick as a junior, as well as a co-winner of the Nittany Lions' Most Valuable Defensive Player award. He started 12 games, recording 41 tackles, 15 for loss, and 7.5 sacks on the year.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shareef-miller/32004d49-4c37-3761-a7aa-6aba5fc8a5bd
Foster Moreau,"A New Orleans native, Moreau has worked himself into a starting tight end for his home-state team. As a true freshman, he played in 12 games and started one, but did not catch a pass. He started 3 of 11 games as a sophomore, catching six passes for 79 yards and one touchdown. The team made him a more regular target in 2017, and Moreau took advantage with 24 receptions for 278 yards and three touchdowns in 13 starts. He started all 13 games in 2018, putting up similar statistics to the previous year (22-272-12.4, two scores).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/foster-moreau/32004d4f-5209-6402-e68b-97ba5fd58ae3
Stanley Morgan,"Morgan excelled in football as a youth, a two-time All-State pick from New Orleans and top-30 receiver prospect nationally. He got on the field right away, starting three of 13 games played as a freshman and catching 25 passes for 304 yards (12.2 average) and three scores. He also returned kickoffs (14-324-23.1). Morgan started nine of 13 games in 2016 (33-453-13.7, two TDs) and then had a breakout junior season. He was a second-team All-Big Ten pick in 2017, setting the school record with 986 receiving yards and scoring 10 times on 61 receptions (16.2 average). The school record had stood since Heisman winner Johnny Rodgers had 942 yards in 1972. Morgan broke his own record with 1,004 receiving yards on 70 receptions (14.3 average) with seven scores in 2018, starting all 12 games to again earn second-team all-conference honors. Stanley Morgan is no relation to the former NFL receiver of the same name, and his father has actually been in prison since 2007.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stanley-morgan/32004d4f-5222-6706-9d2c-5359857cc05f
Isaac Nauta,"Nauta (pronounced NAW-tah) started his career with the Bulldogs with a bang, earning Freshman All-American honors from several media outlets after catching 29 passes for 361 yards (12.4 average) and three scores. This success was not surprising given Nauta's status as the top tight end prospect in the country coming out of Florida's IMG Academy (where he transferred for his senior year after winning three state titles at Buford High School in Georgia). His production dropped in his sophomore year, as he made only nine catches for 114 yards and one score (12.7 average) in 15 games (nine starts). Nauta bounced back as a junior, starting 13 of 14 games played and grabbing a career-high 30 receptions for 430 yards (14.3 average) and three touchdowns.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaac-nauta/32004e41-5534-7951-4697-102c243eb698
Josh Oliver,"Oliver was recruited to play a rush end/linebacker by San Jose State out of Paso Robles, as he was an All-State player on that side of the ball. However, the Spartans suffered injuries at the tight end position, and he had experience as a receiver in high school. Oliver actually started four games as a true freshman in 2015, making four catches for 36 yards (9.0 average) and scoring in the fourth quarter of the AutoNation Cure Bowl. Though his receiving totals were meager in 2016 (3-26-8.7, one TD), coaches started him in 9 of 12 games played. Oliver was a larger part of the offense in his junior season, catching 35 passes for 296 yards (8.5 average) and scoring once in 12 games (11 starts). He nearly doubled his yards per reception as a senior, averaging 12.7 yards on his team-high 56 catches (709 total) and scoring four times to earn first-team All-Mountain West Conference honors.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-oliver/32004f4c-4952-4360-2a59-44a3fa93d63f
Trey Pipkins,"Pipkins was a two-year starter at Apple Valley High School in the Twin Cities area before signing with the Cougars. He played in 10 games as a reserve lineman as a redshirt freshman. After a sophomore campaign where he was named second-team All-Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference at left tackle, Pipkins was voted the team's Most Improved Player. He started all 12 games at left tackle in 2017, allowing just one sack and again earning second-team all-NSIC accolades. Pipkins was also an academic all-conference performer as a junior. His play in 10 starts at left tackle as a senior resulted in his finishing third in the voting for the Gene Upshaw Award (top lineman in D2) and being named first-team Division II All-American by the Associated Press and first-team All-NSIC by league coaches.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-pipkins/32005049-5057-9461-c1e8-051341a4a8d1
Germaine Pratt,"Pratt only started one game in three years with the Wolfpack but played in all 39 games as a valued contributor. The former first-team All-State defensive back from North Carolina played free safety for his first two years, making 32 tackles and three pass breakups in 2014 and 32 tackles and an interception in 2015. He redshirted in 2016 after undergoing shoulder surgery and moved from safety to linebacker during that time; Pratt also changed his uniform number from 31 to 3 because he is one of three siblings. Part of a three-man rotation at linebacker in 2017, Pratt compiled 69 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two interceptions, and two pass breakups. He became a leader on defense as a senior, even earning first-team All-ACC honors by racking up 104 tackles, a team-high 10.5 for loss, while tying for the team lead with six sacks despite playing in 11 games (all starts). Pratt missed the regular-season finale with an ankle injury, then decided to sit out the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL Draft.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/germaine-pratt/32005052-4163-5713-12ab-3117ec02a181

The top-100 overall recruit played in all 14 games as a reserve lineman as a true freshman, then moved into the starting lineup for all 13 games at right tackle in 2016. Prince was a 14-game starter on the right side in 2017, using his large frame to earn third-team All-Big Ten honors. He was a team captain and first-team all-conference pick in 2018, starting all 14 games at right tackle.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-prince/32005052-4948-3688-d3f2-077638b364a5
Sheldrick Redwine,"Redwine joined his Killian High School teammate, safety Jaquan Johnson, in staying home for his college career. Redwine played 12 games as a true freshman, making 14 stops as a reserve cornerback and special-teamer. Redwine started five games at cornerback as a sophomore, collecting 28 tackles and two pass breakups. The versatile defender moved from corner to safety in the spring of 2017, then started 12 games there in the fall, racking up 59 tackles (2.5 for loss), intercepting two passes with six total pass breakups. ACC coaches voted Redwine honorable mention all-conference after his senior season (64 tackles, 3.5 for loss, three sacks, three interceptions, two pass breakups in 13 starts).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sheldrick-redwine/32005245-4479-0651-4e15-c041fee677e0
Hunter Renfrow,"Renfrow is the third college football player in his family. His father, Tim, played at Wofford, but did have an interception against Clemson in his career. His brother, Cole, played tight end for the Tigers. Renfrow's hard work and bloodlines helped him stand out as a redshirt freshman walk-on, starting 10 games and catching 33 passes for 492 yards and five touchdowns. He was the Co-Player of the Game (with quarterback Deshaun Watson) in the national title game against Alabama. Renfrow missed time in the Clemson's national championship season, but still started 9 of 11 games (44-495, six TD) and shared the team's Hustle Award on offense with left tackle Mitch Hyatt. He was a third-team All-ACC pick as the Tigers' top receiver in 2017, starting 13 of 14 games played and grabbing 60 passes for 602 yards and three scores. Though Renfrow became somewhat less of a factor on offense in 2018 due to the Tigres' young talent at the position, ACC coaches voted him third-team all-conference as the 15-game starter corralled 49 passes for 534 yards (10.9 average) and one touchdown. His career accomplishments earned him the Brandon Burlsworth Trophy as the top senior who began his career as a walk-on.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hunter-renfrow/32005245-4e35-8499-ff02-b25484b87290
Dru Samia,"Oklahoma signed Samia (pronounced suh-MEE-uh) as a top 15 offensive tackle recruit nationally out of Sacramento. He started 9 of 12 games at right tackle his true freshman year. In 2016, however, after a start at right tackle in the opener, he was moved to right guard for the final 12 games to earn honorable mention All-Big 12 accolades. Samia stayed at right guard as a junior, starting 12 of 13 games played to land second-team all-conference honors. He was ejected in the Sooners' hotly-contested game against West Virginia for throwing a punch. Samia started all 14 games on the Joe Moore Award-winning Oklahoma offensive line in 2018, garnering second-team All-American notice from the Associated Press and a first-team All-Big 12 nod from league coaches.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dru-samia/32005341-4d03-1944-4710-58ebf1a89b9c

He struggled through a leg injury his junior year but continued to play, earning the Huskies' Don James Perseverance Award for his efforts. He caught seven passes for 84 yards on the year, starting 8 of 10 games played. It was the second time Sample had received a major postseason award from the team, as he was the recipient of the Tough Husky Award after his redshirt freshman season (5-45-9.0, two receiving TDs in 13 games with seven starts.)

Missouri Valley Football coaches named him first-team all-conference in 2017, as he started all 12 games and accumulated 57 tackles, 12 for loss, a team-high 7.5 sacks, and three pass breakups.

Kendall Sheffield,"Sheffield signed with Alabama for the 2015 season as a high school All-American and top-five cornerback prospect nationally out of Missouri City, Texas. He redshirted that fall but then decided to transfer from Tuscaloosa, signing with Blinn Junior College for the 2016 season so he did not have to sit out a year. Sheffield joined the Buckeyes for the 2017 season, played in all 14 games (three starts) making 40 tackles with nine pass breakups. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick as a junior, posting 35 stops, two interceptions, and eight pass breakups in 14 starts.

Devin Singletary,"Singletary committed to Illinois during the recruiting process, but a late push by FAU coaches caused him to reconsider and stay in-state. The 2015 Sun Sentinel's All-Palm Beach County Player of the Year and two-time all-state pick at American Heritage High School played a prominent role in his first season with the Owls, earning honorable mention All-Conference USA and All-Freshman C-USA honors with 1,021 yards and 12 touchdowns on 152 carries (6.7 average) and 163 yards on 26 receptions. The man they call ""Motor"" (his father had the same moniker at Norfolk State) became a national name in 2017, leading the nation with 32 rushing touchdowns, tying for the national lead with 301 carries and ranking fourth with 1,920 yards (6.4 average) to grab first-team all-conference and second-team Associated Press All-American notice. While the Owls did not have the same team success his junior year, Singletary still wowed C-USA coaches with his rushing prowess, earning first-team all-conference honors after leading the league with 261 carries for 1,348 yards (5.2 average) and 22 scores (which again placed him among the nation's leaders).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devin-singletary/32005349-4e18-6919-d1e6-003f4632ba87
Cameron Smith,"Smith was expected to be a star for the Trojans after earning High School All-American honors. He actually started building his reputation as a fourth-grader, as he suited up against eighth-graders due to his instincts and toughness. The honors started early in his collegiate career, garnering Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice in 2015 (78 tackles, one sack, three interceptions, three pass breakups). The Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year only played in 10 games (nine starts) because he had season-ending surgery on torn knee ligaments. Smith somehow returned for the 2016 season opener, receiving second-team all-conference accolades with 83 tackles, seven for loss, and four pass breakups in 13 starts. He was a first-team All-Pac-12 player in 2017, starting 13 of 14 games played (sat out first half of opener due to targeting call in previous year's bowl game). He led USC with 112 stops, 11 of which went for losses, intercepting one pass, and breaking up three passes.

Jace Sternberger,"Jace is the son of two athletes, his father a football player at Southeastern Oklahoma and his mother a two-time All-American basketball player at the same school. He signed with Kansas out of high school, but only caught one pass for five yards as a redshirt freshman in 2016. Wishing to make more of an impact, he transferred to Northeastern Oklahoma A&M where he got his chance to contribute (21 catches, 336 yards, 16.0 average, six touchdowns). FBS coaches lined up to recruit him after that performance, and he decided to roll with new A&M Head Coach Jimbo Fisher. That turned out to be the correct choice, as Sternberger became a consensus All-American, first-team All-SEC recipient, and the Aggies' Offensive MVP by setting team highs with 48 receptions, 832 yards, and 10 touchdowns in 13 games (12 starts).",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jace-sternberger/32005354-4556-8639-5a78-bfa1754fcc8f
Jarrett Stidham,"Stidham began his career at Baylor, but the firing of coach Art Briles due to the sexual assault scandal on campus caused him to look elsewhere. He was a big signing for Briles, a top-50 overall prospect nationally from Stephenville, Texas, who passed for nearly 3,000 yards and 35 touchdowns and ran for almost 1,000 more yards as a senior. Stidham played in 10 games with three starts as a true freshman, completing 69 percent of his passes (75-of-109) for 1,265 yards, 12 touchdowns, and two interceptions. He took online courses at McLennan Community College in 2016 and practiced with a local high school team to keep his arm in shape. The preparation paid off, as he excelled for the Tigers in his first year on the Plains. The SEC Newcomer of the Year and second-team all-conference quarterback completed 66.5 percent of his throws (246-of-370) for 3,158 yards, 18 touchdowns and six interceptions. The highlight of his year was the team's Iron Bowl win over Alabama (21-of-28, 237 yards). Stidham did not take a step forward as a junior, completing only 60.7 percent of his throws (224-of-369) for 2,794 yards, 18 touchdowns, and five interceptions in a somewhat disappointing 8-5 season.",6.1,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jarrett-stidham/32005354-4912-9837-7193-9c8d8376b821

He started all 13 games as a sophomore, posting 43 stops, two for loss, one interception, and two pass breakups. League coaches voted him honorable mention All-Pac-12 in 2018 as he made 57 tackles, intercepted one pass, and broke up five others in 10 starts. An L.A.

He spent most of the next two years watching from the sideline, however. Watts played in just one contest in 2016 (one assisted tackle) and five games off the bunch in 2017 (four tackles). He finally earned a starting role in 2018, beginning 11 of 12 games played, and wound up leading the squad with seven sacks among his 49 tackles, 8.5 for loss.

Trayveon Williams,"Williams was a star back at Houston's C.E. King High School, rushing for about 4,000 yards and over 40 touchdowns in his final two seasons there. That success put him in the top 10 for all-purpose running back recruits in the country and landed him many scholarship opportunities. Williams stayed in-state, and quickly became a difference-maker for the Aggies, becoming the first true freshman in program history to run for over 1,000 yards (1,057 on 156 carries, 6.8 per, eight touchdowns) while also catching 19 passes for 91 yards and returning five kickoffs for 82 yards (16.4 average) in 13 games (two starts). He contributed heavily again as a sophomore in 12 starts as a runner (173-798-4.6, eight touchdowns), receiver (20 catches, 192 yards, 9.6 average), and kickoff returner (six returns, 183 yards, 30.5 average).

Gerald Willis,"Willis has had a rocky college career. He came into the 2014 season at the University of Florida as a first-team USA Today All-American from New Orleans, playing eight games as a reserve (14 tackles). He was dismissed from the Gators, however, for multiple transgressions including a reported fight with quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg. Willis transferred to Miami for the 2016 season, when he played in nine games as a reserve (19 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, and two pass breakups). He took a leave of absence from the team in 2017, but played with the scout team while working out family/personal issues. That time off apparently worked out, as Willis became one of the most productive defensive linemen in college football in 2018. He was an Associated Press second-team All-American and second-team All-ACC selection, finishing among the nation's leaders with 18 tackles for loss (among 59 total tackles with four sacks) in 12 games.

Jordan Brailford,"Several schools west of the Mississippi had interest in Brailford coming out of Tulsa's Booker T. Washington High School, where he was a first-team all-state pick his senior year (98 tackles, 11 sacks). The home-state Cowboys won out, and after a redshirt season, Brailford contributed in 10 games his freshman year (23 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one sack). A shin injury knocked him out for the 2016 season, and he was awarded a medical hardship redshirt for that season. The following spring, Brailford missed time after requiring surgery on his shoulder.  He was ready to go for the fall, though he played the first four games as a reserve before moving into the starting line-up for the final nine contests. He was a second-team All-Big 12 selection that year, posting 57 tackles, 10.5 for loss, and 4.5 sacks.

Isaiah Buggs,"Buggs excelled on the high school football field with 102 tackles, 19 for loss in his final season. However, he was over-aged coming into high school, losing a year of eligibility. He did not earn enough high school credits for NCAA eligibility, so he attended Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College for two seasons. Buggs made an impact as a freshman there (59 tackles, eight for loss, four sacks) and was considered the top junior college recruit in the country after the 2016 season (75 tackles, 10 for loss, 3.5 sacks). Nick Saban brought ""Big Pooh"" into the fold in 2017, when he started all 13 games and compiled 51 tackles, four for loss, and 1.5 sacks.

His father played football at St. Thomas University, a private school in the Twin Cities. Cashman got preferred walk-on status at Minnesota after earning first-team all-state honors as a senior (his Eden Prairie High teams won four straight state titles). He played in 13 games on special teams as a true freshman (four tackles) and then stepped into a key reserve role as a sophomore, making 45 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and earning the Holiday Bowl Most Valuable Player award (12 tackles, two for loss, one sack) in the team's win over Washington State. He was a reserve again in 2017, playing in all 12 games (30 tackles, five for loss, two sacks). His persistence paid off in his senior season, as Big Ten coaches named him third-team all-conference after he led the Gophers with 104 tackles (15 for loss, 2.5 sacks) in 12 games (11 starts).

John Cominsky,"Cominsky was a highly-recruited option quarterback out of Barberton, Ohio. He enrolled at the University of Charleston (in West Virginia) as a 218-pound defensive end, so a redshirt season was in order. The work he put in during his time on the scout team made him an immediate starter in 2015 (37 tackles, five for loss, four sacks, three pass breakups). Cominsky earned second-team All-Mountain East honors as a sophomore (41 tackles, four for loss, 2.5 sacks) and then took a large step forward in 2017, becoming a first-team all-league pick with 23 tackles for loss (6.5 sacks, 73 total stops).

The Chippewas were happy to have him, especially after he garnered first-team All-Mid-American Conference honors as an 11-game starter, making 24 tackles (three for loss), intercepting one pass, and leading the team with 12 pass breakups. Crawford had a strong career at OSU before back problems sidelined him for the final seven games of the 2017 season. He had 17 tackles and two pass breakups in five starts that year. In 2016, he was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 and USA Today Freshman All-American selection after starting all 12 games, making 70 tackles, intercepting one pass and tying for the team lead with 10 pass breakups.

Crosby broke out as a sophomore, earning first-team All-MAC and team Most Valuable Defensive Player honors after starting all 12 games and compiling 57 tackles, 16.5 for loss, and a team-high 11 sacks and four forced fumbles.  MAC coaches voted him first-team all-conference in 2018, as well, rewarding him for his 70 tackles, 19 for loss, 7.5 sacks, four pass breakups, and four forced fumbles in 12 starts.

Felton Davis,"Mark Dantonio landed a nice receiver recruit for the 2015 class in Davis, a Richmond, Virginia, native who was also an All-Metro hurdler in high school. He played in seven games as a true freshman but did not catch a pass until the Big Ten Championship due to the team's depth at the position (he ended the year with 2-50-25.0). Davis saw the field more regularly in 2016, starting 2 of 12 games played and catching 12 passes for 150 yards (12.5 average) and a score. He began approaching his potential as a junior, gaining third-team All-Big Ten honors as MSU's leading receiver (55-776-14.1, nine TD). The team's Most Improved Player on Offense for 2017 started all 13 games that year. As a senior, Davis was named honorable mention All-Big Ten by both coaches and media despite playing in only seven games due to a torn Achilles. He finished the season with 31 receptions for 474 yards with a team-leading four receiving TDs. His injury will prevent him from participating in the combine.

Keelan Doss,"Doss missed his junior season of high school football, thus falling through the recruiting cracks a bit despite a strong senior effort at Alameda High School (29 receptions, 577 yards, nine touchdowns) in California. He started two of 10 games played as a true freshman (22 receptions, 325 yards, 14.8 ypc, two touchdowns) but then missed the 2015 campaign with an ankle injury. Doss returned with a vengeance in 2016, receiving second-team All-Big Sky accolades by grabbing 66 throws for 911 yards and 10 touchdowns in 11 games (10 starts). He became an elite talent in 2017, finishing as a finalist for the Walter Payton Award as the top player in the FCS, as well as an Associated Press FCS All-American and Big Sky Offensive Player of the Year. Doss led the FCS in receptions (10.5) and receiving yards (136.3) per game, totaling 115 and 1,499 respectively while scoring seven times in 11 contests. He scored a 42-yard touchdown on his only rush of the year. Doss excelled with the Aggies again in 2018, helping former Boise State and Colorado coach Dan Hawkins win a Big Sky title and make the FCS quarterfinals. The unanimous first-team all-conference selection and second-team AP FCS All-American scored nine times in 13 starts, ranking among the nation's leaders in receptions (118) and receiving yards (1,334, 11.3 per reception).

David Edwards,"Edwards was a high school quarterback that operated the veer offense for three years at Downers Grove North, a western Chicago suburb. He grew into a spot on the Badgers' offensive line as a redshirt freshman in 2016, starting seven of 13 games at right tackle. Big Ten coaches voted Edwards a second-team all-conference performer while national media voted him to the Associated Press third-team All-American squad in 2017. Edwards started all 14 games as a sophomore, blocking for stud freshman running back Jonathan Taylor. Before the 2018 season began, however, Edwards hurt his shoulder. Instead of shutting it down for the year, he played through the injury for 10 starts at his right tackle spot before deciding to rest the shoulder so he could be at 100 percent for the pre-draft process. Edwards was a second-team All-Big Ten selection despite missing those contests.

T.J. Edwards,"Looking at Edwards now, it's tough to see him as a high school quarterback. The three-star recruit and two-time honorable mention All-Illinois selection was clearly a linebacker prospect when he arrived at UW. After redshirting the 2014 season, he exploded on the scene, earning Freshman All-American honors by leading his squad with 84 tackles (6.5 for loss) and breaking up four passes in 13 starts inside. Edwards was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2016, again topping his defense with 89 stops while posting 8.5 tackles for loss, three sacks, three interceptions and two pass breakups in 13 games (12 starts).

He earned second-team All-Ohio Valley Conference honors as a junior in 2017, again starting all 11 games on the blind side.

He started the final nine games of the year after serving as the backup in the first four, accumulating 966 yards on 163 carries (5.9 average) and scoring eight times. Homer also caught 19 passes for 219 yards (11.5 average) and a touchdown. ACC coaches voted him second-team all-conference for his efforts, a reward repeated in 2018 when he started all 13 games, leading the Hurricanes with 985 rushing yards on 164 carries (6.0 average) and scoring four times (also contributing 19-186-9.8 as a receiver). As a true freshman in 2016, Homer did not receive many opportunities on offense (7-44-6.3 rushing) but contributed eight tackles on special teams coverage units.",5.9,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-homer/3200484f-4d65-5558-456b-7b9fa9f97090
Mike Jackson,"Jackson came to Miami from Birmingham a four-star recruit, but got stuck behind the Hurricanes' depth at cornerback. He played in 25 games as a reserve in 2015 (five tackles) and 2016 (seven tackles, one pass breakups). He found his way into the starting lineup 10 times in 13 games played as a junior, however, tying for the team lead with four interceptions. Jackson also had 43 stops, three for loss, and five pass breakups on the year. Jackson (who has a young child also named Michael) garnered honorable mention All-ACC notice as a senior, starting all 13 games, posting 42 tackles, 3.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks, and six pass breakups.",5.9,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-jackson/32004a41-4300-0004-a1b9-6631a951b6e5
Gary Jennings,"Jennings' role with the Mountaineers has grown throughout his career in Morgantown. He played in 13 games as a reserve receiver (7-116-16.6, one TD) and served as the team's top punt returner (13-69-5.3; also 5-117-23.4 kick returns) his freshman year. Jennings started once at receiver in 2016 (10-165-16.5, two TD in 13 games) but was still primarily a punt returner (21-39-1.9). A spot opened up as a starting receiver in 2017, and Jennings took full advantage, earning second-team All-Big 12 honors and winning the team's Offensive Player of the Year award. He ranked fourth in the country with 97 receptions, which covered 1,096 yards, and scored once. Jennings' numbers were down in 2018 (54-917-17.0, 13 TD in 11 games, eight starts), partially because he fought a high ankle sprain the second half of the season. He was still productive enough to earn honorable mention All-Big 12 accolades. Jennings sat out the team's bowl game to rest his ankle and prepare for the draft.",5.9,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gary-jennings/32004a45-4e47-8992-361a-38518b10747e
Bisi Johnson,"Olabisi Johnson, whose Nigerian first name means ""to bring prosperity to your family,"" hopes to do just that by becoming a professional receiver. He has been overshadowed by talented Rams receivers in Michael Gallup and Preston Williams during his final three years at CSU, but his production has been noteworthy. He caught 41 passes for 595 yards (14.5 average) and two scores while returning 14 punts for 122 yards (8.7 average) in 12 games (seven starts) in 2017. Johnson started eight games across from Gallup in 2016, averaging a strong 21.9 yards per catch (613 yards) and scoring four times on 28 catches.

Drew Lewis,"Lewis has football running through his veins. His father, Will, played cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks and was a personnel evaluator for multiple NFL teams. His uncle, Tim, was a star corner at Pitt and played in the NFL until a neck injury forced him to the sidelines; he coached in the league for 30 years, however. Cousin Louis Riddick was another Pitt defensive back and played in the NFL before becoming a scout and personnel director, and then joining ESPN as an analyst. Lewis signed with home-state Washington as an All-King County pick but was dismissed from the team after his redshirt season for violating team rules. He played at Coffeyville Community College in 2015, racking up 63 tackles despite missing parts of five games with a broken thumb. Lewis transferred to UC for the 2016 season, when he played in 14 games as a reserve (eight tackles). Given a starting role in all 12 games his junior year, Lewis led his team in tackles with 119 (four for loss, four pass breakups). Lewis only started six of 12 games in 2018, but made 66 stops with six coming behind the line of scrimmage (two sacks).

He practiced with the team that fall, and then worked through the summer to become eligible in 2017. He started six games as a junior, grabbing 19 passes for 166 yards (8.7 average) and a touchdown on a team that lacked consistency in the passing game.

Mack again played in 13 games as a sophomore, but made fewer plays (25 stops, 2.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks). Though his total tackles dropped in 2017 (19), Mack got his first college start and had five tackles for loss and a sack on the season.

However, he injured his left leg at Arizona State, ending his season prematurely. Miller returned to start 12 contests in 2018, posting 26 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions, six pass breakups, and two forced fumbles.

Mitchell took his redshirt off in 2016 to play in six contests as a reserve receiver (2-9-4.5) and returner (7-26-3.7 punt returns, 3-49-16.3 kickoffs). He was a top-100 prospect nationally after winning Tennessee's Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior (62-1,143 receiving, 31 total TDs) at White Station High School in Memphis.

Jalin Moore,"Moore signed with App State to stick around North Carolina after earning regional Offensive Player of the Year honors as a high school senior running back. As a redshirt freshman, Sun Belt Conference coaches named him to the All-Freshman squad (99-731-7.4, five  rushing TDs). Moore earned those coaches' respect again in 2016, as they named him the SBC Offensive Player of the Year as a part-time starter (237-1,450-5.9, 10 rushing TDs; seven starts in 13 games). Moore was a first-team all-conference selection his junior year, leading the conference with 1,037 yards (183 carries, 5.7 per; 12 TD) despite missing two games due to injury. He was the Dollar General Bowl MVP with 125 rushing yards and three scores, and also caught 12 passes for 163 yards and a touchdown for the year.

His season ended with two regular-season games remaining, however, due to a suspension for violation of team rules. That suspension led to his decision to enter the 2019 NFL Draft as an early entry. Roemer was an All-State pick as an offensive and defensive lineman at Fernley High School in Nevada (also participating in basketball, swimming and wrestling) before heading to San Diego.

David Sills,"Sills' story is well-known in college football circles. He was offered a scholarship by then-USC head coach Lane Kiffin at the age of 13 and started on varsity as an eighth-grader. Sills broke a knuckle on his throwing hand as a junior, which changed his throwing motion. He also suffered an ankle injury his senior year, missing all but three games. West Virginia offered him a scholarship, but he moved to receiver for his freshman year, playing in eight games and making seven catches for 131 yards (18.7 average) and two touchdowns. Sills caught the game-winning touchdown against Arizona State in the Cactus Bowl that season. However, he still wanted to play quarterback, so he transferred to El Camino College, where he was an all-conference signal-caller (1,636 yards, 15 TD). That performance wasn't enough to convince an FBS school to offer him as a quarterback, so he returned to WVU to play receiver. That proved to be the correct move, as he and new Mountaineers quarterback Will Grier combined 60 times for 980 yards (16.3 average) in 13 games. Sills also tied for the nation's best mark with 18 receiving touchdowns, leading him to be named a finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, a second-team Associated Press All-American, and first-team All-Big selection. Sills ranked second in the country with 15 receiving touchdowns in 2018, and even though his overall production decreased (65-986-15.2), he was still an Associated Press third-team All-American and first-team All-Big 12 pick for his efforts.

While away, he took a semester off of school (working as a security guard) and changed his last name from White to Worthington, his mother's maiden name. He was allowed to return in 2017 and made most of the opportunity by making a team-high 66 solo tackles (86 total, six for loss), intercepting three passes, and breaking up seven others.

Saquan Hampton,"Hampton showed glimpses of becoming a potential star during his first three years with the Scarlet Knights, but injuries to both shoulders shortened his sophomore and junior seasons. The New Jersey native got into the lineup as a redshirt freshman, starting 1 of 12 games played (28 tackles, one interception, two pass breakups). He started seven game in 2016, but missed five games and played with a harness through the second half of the year (46 tackles, three for loss, one interception). He started 7 of 8 games played in 2017 due to another shoulder problem (38 tackles, three pass breakups). Hampton played well during a healthy senior season, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as well as his team's MVP Award after leading the conference with 1.3 passes defended per game (three interceptions, 13 pass breakups in 12 starts). He posted 65 tackles on the year, three for loss.",5.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/saquan-hampton/32004841-4d78-3389-e6f4-ff57543e7708
Terrill Hanks,"Hanks went from a football hotbed in Miami, where he had 100 tackles as a senior at Immaculata LaSalle High School, to matriculate to Las Cruces. The move paid off early as he started 11 of 12 games and racked up 81 stops, 6.5 for loss, three interceptions, and seven pass breakups. He led the Aggies with 12 tackles for loss in 2016 among his 103 tackles, as well as two interceptions and five PBUs in 12 games (11 starts). Sun Belt coaches named his honorable mention all-conference in 2017 after he was credited with 111 tackles, 15 for loss, seven sacks, two interceptions, and four PBUs.

Penny Hart,"Marjahn ""Penny"" Mathias Hart was not a highly-recruited player due to his lack of size. The former high school running back/quarterback from Roswell, Georgia, announced his talent to the Sun Belt Conference in his initial season with the Panthers. He was the SBC Freshman of the Year in 2015, first-team all-conference, and a Freshman All-American after leading the league with 5.5 catches per game and 84.5 receiving yards per game (71-1,099, eight TD total). Hart missed all but two quarters of the 2016 season (8-61-7.6, one TD) due to a hamstring injury and a broken foot and redshirted. He returned to the top all-conference squad the following year, leading the Sun Belt with 74 receptions for 1,121 yards (15.1) and eight scores. He missed most of the regular-season finale and the bowl game that year with an ankle injury, though he did make a 27-yard catch in the AutoNation Cure Bowl win over Western Kentucky. Hart was a third-team All-Sun Belt pick as a redshirt junior, acting as an all-purpose threat by leading the team in receiving (49-669-13.7, two TD), punt returns (9-158-17.6, one TD) and kick returns (15-299-19.9).",5.8,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/penny-hart/32004841-5269-5794-21c2-9776a5a0a3d4

He got on the field in 14 games as a true freshman (10 tackles, one for loss) but redshirted the following year due to the team's depth. Coaches put him in the starting lineup at defensive end in 2016, where he made 51 tackles, 9.5 for loss, and three sacks in 12 games. He moved to linebacker as a junior, posting 59 stops, 11.5 behind the line, 3.5 sacks, and led the Ducks with three forced fumbles.

Albert Huggins,"Trying to get on the field as a defensive lineman for Clemson is very difficult. Even a talented player like Huggins, who was a Parade All-American and top 100 overall recruit from South Carolina, has struggled to earn starts behind the likes of Dexter Lawrence, Scott Pagano and Christian Wilkins. He did start two contests in 2017, making 21 tackles, five for loss, and 1.5 sacks in 13 games played. Even though Huggins did not start in 2015 or 2016, he made plays as a freshman (12 tackles in six games) and sophomore (20 tackles, three sacks in 13 games) for the Tigers. He received his best opportunity in the college football playoffs in 2018 when he started for teammate Dexter Lawrence, who was suspended.

Hyatt was a second-team all-conference pick after starting 14 games on the blind side in 2016, scoring a 90 percent grade against Alabama in his team's title game victory. The Associated Press named Hyatt a second-team All-American in 2017, and he also earned the ACC's Jacobs Blocking Trophy and first-team all-conference accolades as a third-year starter on the left side.

An unspecified injury kept Knight out of early season contests in 2017, but he played in the final 10 games with eight starts at that right tackle spot.

He started all 12 games in 2017, leading Ole Miss by covering 17 yards per reception (41-698) and scoring seven times.

He tried out for BYU as a kicker after that point, but the Cougars weren't interested.

He landed on the Missouri Valley Conference All-Newcomer Team after a freshman season where he was a factor as a rusher (90 carries, 503 yards, 5.6 ypc, two touchdowns), receiver (8 receptions, 55 yards, 6.9 ypr, one touchdown), and especially as a kick returner (16 attempts, 585 yards, school-record 36.6 per return, two touchdowns) in 15 games. Anderson suffered a sophomore slump due to injuries, playing in just nine games as a reserve (38 carries, 253 yards, 6.7 ypc, one touchdown rushing; 4 receptions, 38 yards, 9.5 ypr,; 18 attempts, 363 yards, 20.2 average on kick returns). He came back strong in 2017, however, starting eight of 15 games and earning second-team All-MVFC honors with 1,216 rushing yards and 12 scores on 234 carries (5.2 ypc). Anderson also caught eight passes for 156 yards (19.5 ypr) and three touchdowns. He again started eight of 15 games in 2018, helping NDSU win yet another national title as the team's leading rusher (124 carries, 924 yards, 7.5 ypc, nine touchdowns). The second-team All-MVFC selection contributed in the passing game (12 receptions, 199 yards, 16.6 ypr, three touchdowns) and as a kick returner (10 attempts, 219 yards, 21.9 average), as well.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bruce-anderson/3200414e-4411-3318-d92c-60cbded46e0d
George Asafo-Adjei,"""Big George"" Asafo-Adjei (pronounced ah-SAH-fo ah-JAY) was born in the Bronx but played his final two years of high school football at Lakota West in Ohio. He was a four-star prospect when he signed with Kentucky (over Florida, Ohio State and others) after achieving all-state status on the football field and wrestling for one season. Asafo-Adjei enrolled a semester early in Lexington, which helped him earn the starting role at right tackle the first three games of his freshman year (he played in 11 games overall). He was a reserve in 12 games the following year before starting 8 of 13 contests at right tackle in 2017. He started 12 games at right tackle in 2018, missing one game due to injury.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/george-asafo-adjei/32004153-4149-6543-6655-19bd3dc03db8
Zack Bailey,"Bailey was a South Carolina Mr. Football finalist in 2014 and a four-star recruit, so signing with the Gamecocks was a logical move. The Summerville native played in all 12 games as a true freshman, starting five (three at center, two at left guard). Bailey was a full-time starter at left guard in 2016, beginning all 13 contests there. He moved to right tackle for his junior year, starting 8 of 9 games played. He missed four mid-season games, however, with an ankle injury. He fell to injury again in 2018, breaking his leg (left fibula) in the Cavaliers' regular-season finale. Bailey had already earned second-team All-SEC accolades for his play during the fall, and the injury is not expected to keep him from working out for teams before the draft.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zack-bailey/32004241-4969-7604-1b25-a545ad33dc93

He went from a first-team All-State pick in high school in 2014 to a starting corner as a true freshman in 2015. Baity started the final four games of that season, playing in 12 overall, making 19 tackles and breaking up two others. He started all 13 games the following year, tying for the team lead with three interceptions while compiling 42 tackles, two for loss, and seven pass breakups. Baity started 12 of 13 games played as a junior, and was credited with 49 tackles, two interceptions, and a team-high nine pass breakups.

Baron made 56 of his 58 PAT attempts that season. He did not receive as many opportunities for field goals in 2017 but still hit on an 80 percent clip (12-15, long 43) and converted all 52 PAT tries. He returned to the all-conference roll again in 2018, earning second-team All-Mountain West accolades by making all of his PAT tries (27-27) and 80 percent of his FG attempts (17-22) including all five tries of 50 yards or more (long of 54). Baron also handled kickoffs for SDSU in 2016 (33 touchbacks on 94 kickoffs), 2017 (33 of 77) and 2018 (45 of 62).",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-baron/32004241-5254-9809-3e70-4802f51adfba
Alex Bars,"Bars is one of several prospects for the 2019 NFL Draft that comes from a family of college football players. His father, Joe, played linebacker at Notre Dame. His brother, Blake, played on the offensive line at Michigan and another brother, Brad, played on the defensive line at Penn State.  That lineage made Bars a ballyhooed prospect coming to South Bend, a top 100 overall recruit and second-team USA Today All-American. He played in six games as a redshirt freshman, starting twice at left guard for injured Quenton Nelson before suffering an ankle injury himself that ended his season. Bars came back to start all 12 games in 2016 at right tackle, then started all 13 games at right guard in 2017. His senior year came to a halt in the fifth game, as a knee injury forced the team's starting left guard to undergo season-ending surgery.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-bars/32004241-5271-0449-53a6-0fa4423198e9

He started 9 of 10 games in his senior campaign (39 tackles, three interceptions, two pass breakups), missing the end of the regular season with an ankle injury. The former four-star recruit played well when having to step in for Rickey Jefferson the previous year, starting the final seven contests and making 39 tackles and four pass breakups in 12 overall appearances. Battle played in one game with no statistics in 2014 before putting on the redshirt, then saw action in all 12 games as a reserve the next season (five tackles, one interception, one pass breakup).",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-battle/32004241-5447-2449-1e31-7952633ba900
Terry Beckner,"Missouri made a recruiting coup by landing Beckner, considered one of the top-10 recruits nationally out of East St. Louis. He immediately made an impact, starting five of 10 games played and garnering Freshman All-American honors with 27 tackles, eight for loss, and three sacks in 2015. Unfortunately, he tore his right ACL and MCL against BYU, which ended his season prematurely. His sophomore season (24 tackles, two for loss in seven games as a reserve) also ended due to a knee injury (left ACL) and he was also suspended in January 2016 for marijuana possession. Beckner was finally healthy in 2017, winning the Tigers' Interior Lineman of the Year award, starting all 13 games and tying for the team lead with seven sacks (38 total tackles, 11 for loss, one interception, two pass breakups). SEC coaches rewarded Becker for his play in 2018 by voting him second-team all-conference.

Kendall Blanton,"Blanton is a Missouri native whose father (Jerry) was a linebacker at the University of Kentucky and played seven years with the Kansas City Chiefs. Kendall earned his own headlines as a top national tight end recruit at Blue Springs South High School, also leading his school's basketball teams in blocked shots as a junior and senior. As a redshirt freshman in 2015, he primarily played on special teams for eight games (no receptions). He became an integral part of the offense the following fall, catching 16 passes for 161 yards (10.1 average) and scoring three times in 12 games (two starts). He played in 13 games with three starts in 2017, making six catches for 138 yards (23.0 average) and a score.

Amani Bledsoe,"Bledsoe was the No. 1-rated prospect from Kansas and a four-star recruit when he signed with the Sooners. He played in the first six games of his true freshman season (three tackles, one sack) but failed a test for performance-enhancing drugs after taking a supplement that included a banned substance. He appealed the one-year suspension from the NCAA and sued the organization but wound up being out for the full year. He returned four games into the 2017 season, and started 8 of 10 games played (19 tackles, three for loss, two sacks).

He also set national high school records with 91 passing touchdowns in one year and 229 for his career. Browning enrolled at UW a semester early, so it was not surprising he moved into the starting lineup as a true freshman (233-368-63.3, 2,955 yards, 16 TD, 10 INT in 12 starts).

Davis led the team with seven pass breakups, intercepted a pass and posted 36 tackles in 12 games (with starts in the final five contests). He started 4 of 12 games as a sophomore (15 tackles, two PBU) and then came on late in his junior year, starting the final four games (five total for the year), compiling 26 stops, two interceptions and three pass breakups. Davis was an honorable mention All-Big 12 selection in 2018 after starting 12 of 13 games played and recording 42 stops, four for loss, an interception and eight pass breakups.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davante-davis/32004441-5638-7018-d56c-1758cb7c5348
Deshaun Davis,"Davis has been motivated to excel since he was 12 years old, when a teacher told him he would be in jail or dead by age 18. He was a top-20 linebacker prospect nationally despite missing his senior year with a knee injury (135 tackles, six forced fumbles as a junior, also played baseball and basketball). Davis had five tackles in 12 games as a reserve in his redshirt freshman season. He was named a starter for all 13 games in 2016, and he responded with 63 tackles, seven for loss, and three pass breakups. He had 10 tackles, four for loss, in the Iron Bowl that year. He led the Tigers in tackles with 82 (10 in the SEC Championship Game vs. Georgia) in his junior campaign, racking up 6.5 tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks.

Taiwan Deal,"Injuries hampered Deal during his time at Wisconsin, but he finished strong for the Badgers. The four-star recruit from DeMatha High School was the Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year his senior year. He redshirted in 2014, then played in 10 games (two starts) in 2015, carrying the ball 117 times for 503 yards (4.3 average) and six touchdowns. He only suited up for six games (one start, 32-164-5.1 rushing) in 2016, playing through an ankle injury that required surgery after the season. Deal aggravated the injury a few months later, forcing him to miss the entire 2017 season. He returned for 2018 as healthy as he had been since 2015 and backed up Jonathan Taylor quite efficiently (82-545-6.6, six TDs).",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taiwan-deal/32004445-4138-0684-14d6-6953181e51f4
Johnnie Dixon,"Dixon starred at West Palm Beach's Dwyer High School, earning four-star recruiting grades and finishing among the top five receiver prospects in the country. The Buckeyes' depth at the position kept him off the field for his first three years on campus. He redshirted in 2014 after playing in two games (no catches), and then made nominal contributions in 2015 (1-29 in five games) and 2016 (6-26-4.3 in seven games). Dixon became the team's deep threat as a junior, leading the team with eight touchdowns and averaging 23.4 yards per catch (18-422) in 13 games as a key reserve. Though he wasn't a team leader in receiving as a senior, his 42 receptions covered 669 yards (15.9) and nine scores in 14 contests (five starts) for the Big Ten champs. He also split kick-return duties during the season (13-240-18.5).",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/johnnie-dixon/32004449-5841-5666-605c-9afdb4538c59
D'Cota Dixon,"Dixon has overcome a rough childhood to become a leader in the Wisconsin secondary. His mother struggled with substance abuse, his brother went to jail after shooting an officer, and his father had his own issues with addiction (and passed away from a heart attack after being clean for a year). He managed to excel in high school football despite those circumstances, and was named a two-time All-State pick. Dixon played in three games as a true freshman (three tackles), but redshirted the season due to injury. He returned to play in all 13 games as a reserve defensive back in 2015 (16 tackles, one pass breakup) before getting his shot as a starter as a sophomore. He started all 14 games, posting 60 tackles, 2.5 for loss, four interceptions and four pass breakups. His most noteworthy pick was the game-clincher against LSU in Lambeau Field, after which Tigers guard Josh Boutte leveled him. Injuries nagged at Dixon throughout the 2017 season, but he started 9 of 12 games played (55 tackles, 3.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, one INT, three PBU). A foot injury limited Dixon in the middle of his final season with the Badgers but Big Ten coaches still voted him third-team all-conference (43 tackles, 2.5 for loss, three pass breakups in nine starts).",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-cota-dixon/32004449-5811-7798-e904-9f6bb9c96348
Greg Dortch,"The diminutive but quick Dortch only played two seasons for Wake, but his impact was felt throughout the ACC as a receiver and returner. He was a playmaker in high school, being named Virginia 5-A Player of the Year as a senior at Richmond's Highland Springs. Wake coaches redshirted him in 2016, limiting his contributions to the scout team. Dortch was a Freshman All-American and second-team All-ACC all-purpose player (53-722-13.6, nine TD receiving) the following fall and also earned honorable mention all-conference honors as a return specialist (20-162-8.1 punt returns; 18-397-22.1 kick returns). In 2018, he was a first-team all-conference selection as both an all-purpose (team-high 89-1,078-12.1, eight TD receiving; 5-20-4.0 rushing) and returner (25-276-11.0, two TD punt returns; 18-376-20.9 kick returns) as a 12-game starter.

Clifton Duck,"Duck has been doubted due to his size (listed at 5-foot-10, 170 pounds) since his high school days, when he was labelled a two-star recruit despite starring on offense, defense, and special teams for powerhouse Butler High School in North Carolina. Sun Belt foes found out quickly of Duck's talents as he won the conference's Freshman of the Year award as well as multiple Freshman All-American honors in 2016. He led the Mountaineers with five interceptions and eight pass breakups (those 13 passes defensed led the conference), while also totaling 57 tackles, 2.5 for loss. Duck actually increased his interception total to six (which ranked fourth in the FBS) in his sophomore season, also compiling 50 stops, three for losses, and six pass breakups to garner first-team all-conference honors. Opponents stayed away from his side of the field more regularly in 2018 but he still managed to post 51 stops, three for loss, one interception, and five pass breakups to earn his third straight first-team All-Sun Belt nod.

Ashton Dulin,"Dulin's become a favorite of small-school scouts after excelling at football and track for Malone University (Ohio). He scored an 82-yard touchdown on his first touch on the collegiate level. In 10 games as a reserve in that freshman year, he caught 19 passes for 329 yards and three scores (also 21 carries, 106 yards, 5.1 ypc rushing, 6 returns, 134 yards, 22.3 average on kick returns) and also acting as a primary returner (18 returns, 353 yards, 19.6 average on kickoffs, 2  returns, 15 yards, 12.5 average on punts). He started all nine games for the Pioneers in 2016, leading the team in receiving (50 catches, 825 yards, 16.5 average, four touchdowns). Dulin earned first-team All-Great Midwest Athletic Conference honors as a junior, starting all 10 games and catching 59 passes for 1,050 yards (17.8 average) and 10 touchdowns. He was also a factor as a rusher (14 carries, 137 yards, 9.8 average, one touchdown) and returner (25 returns, 524 yards, 21.0 average on kickoffs). He was a Division II All-American and the G-MAC Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, catching 11 touchdown passes (61 catches, 984 yards, 16.1 average) and a D2-leading three kickoff return touchdowns (28 returns, 836 yards, 29.9 average). Dulin set school records in the 60-meter dash, 60-meter hurdles and 200-meter dash in the spring of 2018, earning the G-MAC indoor track athlete of the year award.

Jovon Durante,"Durante (pronounced duh-RANT) was a star receiver at Miramar High School in Hollywood, Florida. He signed with West Virginia and became a playmaker for the Mountaineers as a true freshman, playing in 12 games with nine starts and making 24 receptions for 378 yards (15.8 average) and five touchdowns. Durante had a role in the WVU offense in 2016, starting 8 of 13 games played, but was less productive (35-331-9.5, two TD). He transferred from West Virginia before the 2017 season due to differences with the coaching staff. Lane Kiffin recruited Durante out of high school for Alabama when he was the offensive coordinator there, so transferring to play for Kiffin at FAU made sense. While the Owls' 2018 season did not meet expectations, Durante earned honorable mention All-Conference USA honors by leading the parliament with 65 catches for 873 yards (13.4 average) and five scores.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jovon-durante/32004455-5213-7769-aacc-e40c12cf90fd

Given the starting position in all 13 games in 2017, Ellis carried the ball 215 times for 836 yards (3.9 average) for six touchdowns on the year and also became a contributor in the passing game (22 carries, 137 yards, 6.2 average, one touchdown). He was an honorable mention All-ACC performer as a senior, leading the Cavs with 1,026 yards and 10 touchdowns on 215 carries (4.8 average).

He led the Cowboys with six pass breakups and tied for the team lead with three interceptions in 2016, starting all 14 games (111 tackles, six for loss, three fumble recoveries, two forced fumbles). He and Andrew Wingard proved again to be a formidable safety duo in 2017; Epps had 68 stops, five for loss, four interceptions, and four pass breakups in 13 starts as a junior.

In 2017, he started all 13 games and had 22 receptions for 261 yards (11.9 average) and two scores.

Nate Herbig,"Coming into the 2018 season, it was expected that Herbig would have a decision to make about heading to the NFL as an early entrant. Although his junior year did not go as planned, starting only seven games at right guard due to undisclosed injuries, Herbig still earned second-team All-Pac-12 honors. That was enough for him to decide to skip the Cardinal's bowl game and move on to the pros. He was a first-team all-conference selection in 2017, starting 13 games (first two at left guard, 11 of the final 12 at right guard) to help running back Bryce Love become a Heisman Trophy candidate. Herbig, a native of Hawai'i with the fitting nickname ""Big Island"", was rated among the top offensive line recruits in the country after an excellent career at Saint Louis High School. His brother, Nick, was a star player at Saint Louis and finalist for the Manti Te'o Award as the state defensive player of the year in 2018.",5.4,2019,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-herbig/32004845-5204-0461-4e5a-52a088dadfbf

Delaware signed him to an offer, and he played there for three years, earning the captain's letter twice. He spent his eligibility there battling injuries and academic issues. Hills played in 12 games for the Hens as a true freshman (10-8.1, one TD), contributing seven tackles and a blocked punt on special teams. Though he started just one game in 2014, he led UD in rushing (172-952-5.5, six TDs) despite starting just 1 of 12 games played and once again made seven special teams stops (and 9-53-5.9 receiving). After missing all but one game of the 2015 season due to a foot injury, he was only healthy enough during 2016 to start 5 of 7 games played but still led the Hens in rushing (88-728-8.3, seven TDs). Hills sat out the 2017 season due to academics, transferring to Division II Slippery Rock to complete his career. The 2018 SRU team captain became a second-team Associated Press All-American by rushing for a school-record 1,714 yards (on 246 carries, 7.0 average) and catching 28 passes for 193 yards  (6.9 average).

Buffalo came calling, and he starred immediately, earning second-team All-MAC honors in 2016 with a team-high 123 tackles (seven for loss). Hodge stepped up his game in 2017, ranking second in the FBS and setting a school record with 154 tackles (6.5 for loss, three sacks) and intercepting two passes in a first-team all-conference season.

Mikah played as a true freshman at San Diego State, so his path to the pros has already begun (he was signed by the Redskins as an undrafted rookie following the 2018 draft). Alijah, on the other hand, did not play in 2014 even though he was a four-star recruit and All-State pick at Oceanside High School in California. Holder did earn 10 starts in 2015, though, making 37 tackles, breaking up seven passes, and returning his lone interception for a touchdown. He struggled with injuries the next two years, starting just four contests in 2016 (10 tackles, six pass breakups) and playing in eight games the following year (seven starts, 26 tackles, one INT, three PBU).

His senior season was a bit of a letdown, due to a calf injury and the appearance of young Anthony McFarland on the scene. Johnson started nine games in 2018, averaging 7.7 yards per carry but only getting the ball 77 times (509 yards, three TD).

Ward had started 6 of 10 games played as a senior, compiling 41 tackles, nine for loss, 3.5 sacks, and three pass breakups. He started twice while playing in all 12 games for the Monarchs in 2017 (37 tackles, 10 for loss, three sacks) and contributed heavily as a reserve the previous season (25 tackles, 6.5 for loss, five sacks).

His grades needed improvement, however, so he attended Ellsworth Community College for two seasons. After playing in just one game as a freshman, Way was a first-team All-Region pick in 2016, ranking fifth in the junior college ranks with 11 receiving touchdowns. South Alabama hoped he could be a big playmaker for them in 2017, and he delivered. Way was named second-team All-Sun Belt, leading the team in receiving (47 catches, 762 yards, 16.2 average, three touchdowns) after starting 11 of 12 games played.

He started all 13 games as a sophomore, posting 41 tackles, three for loss, an interception and 11 pass breakups. Webster had five tackles and two pass breakups against Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl at the end of the year.

James Williams,"Williams was given his nickname after Boobie Miles from Friday Night Lights, and now he is looking to be a factor on Sundays. He was an all-conference performer at Burbank High School as a junior, receiving interest from multiple FBS programs and a scholarship offer from WSU. A knee injury ended his senior season two games in, however. Cougars coaches kept their offer in place and redshirted Williams in 2015 so he could heal. He stood out in Head Coach Mike Leach's offense the following year, starting two of 13 games played, leading the team in rushing (102 carries, 584 yards, 5.7 ypc, six touchdowns), and showing how much of an impact he could make as a receiver (48 catches, 342 yards, 7.1 average, one touchdown). Williams was the team's leading receiver in 2017, nearly catching more passes (71 catches, 482 yards, 6.8 average, three scores) than he received handoffs (92 carries, 395 yards, 5.5 ypc, one touchdown) in the 13 games (three starts).

Willie Wright,"At 6-foot-2, the former defensive tackle turned offensive tackle will likely move inside where his pass protection background and long arms could work in his favor. Wright is exceptionally quick out of his stance as a run blocker, but doesn't gain as much ground as he should thanks to inconsistent footwork.

Joe Burrow,"Burrow bucked a family trend when he chose to play at Ohio State instead of Nebraska, where his father (Jimmy, long-time defensive coordinator for Frank Solich at Ohio University) and two brothers (Dan, Jamie) suited up. It was tough to blame him, though, as the two-time Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year was a highly coveted national recruit. Burrow was also an all-state point guard who turned down mid-major basketball scholarship opportunities. He did not, however, end up playing much for the Buckeyes. As a redshirt freshman, he played in six games as a backup (22-of-28 passing, 78.6 percent completion rate, 226 yards, two TDs). Burrow played in four games the following year (7-of-11 passing, 63.6 percent completion rate, 61 yards) and then lost the starting job for 2018 to Dwayne Haskins. He decided to transfer to LSU as a graduate student before the season, and the coaches put him into the lineup (219-of-379 passing, 57.8 percent completion rate, 2,894 yards, 16 passing TDs, five INTs; 128 carries for 399 yards, 3.1 yards per carry and seven rushing TDs). He was the first LSU quarterback to throw for 2,500 yards and run for 300 yards in the same season, and he finished the year off with a big performance against UCF in the Fiesta Bowl (394 passing yards with a school-bowl-record five TD passes). The effort portended a strong senior season, but few predicted how strong. Burrow led the Bayou Bengals to a national title in 2019, winning the Heisman Trophy and Maxwell, Walter Camp Player of the Year, Johnny Unitas Golden Arm, and Davey O'Brien Awards, as well as unanimous Associated Press All-American and SEC Offensive Player of the Year honors. The nation's most efficient passer had one of the best seasons in college football history, leading the country in passing yards (5,671), total offense (6,039 yards), completion percentage (76.3, on 402-of-527 passing) and set an NCAA record with 60 touchdown passes in 15 starts.",7.07,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-burrow/32004255-5267-9731-81c8-48673dcec5e2

Simmons started down that road as a sophomore, leading the Tigers in tackles in their national championship season (89 total stops, nine for loss, one interception returned for a touchdown, seven pass breakups, three forced fumbles). He started 14 of 15 games at linebacker just one year after playing in 14 games as a backup safety (45 tackles, three for loss, one sack). His play during the Tigers' national title season got him on the national radar, and his play as a junior (102 tackles, 16 for loss, eight sacks, three interceptions, nine pass breakups in 15 starts) earned him the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker. He was also a finalist for the Chuck Bednarik Award and the Bronko Nagurski and Lott IMPACT Trophies, as well as a first-team Associated Press All-American, ACC Defensive Player of the Year and first-team all-conference selection.

The 2016 first-team all-state pick from Lexington, Kentucky, contributed in 11 games in his first season with the Tide, with one start when the team came out in a six-man line against Ole Miss. Wills was competing against veteran Matt Womack at right tackle in 2018 fall practice when Womack went down to injury. That allowed Wills to start all 15 games that sophomore campaign without looking over his shoulder.

Jerry Jeudy,"Alabama's known for the defensive talent it provides to NFL teams, but Julio Jones, Amari Cooper, and Calvin Ridley have given the Tide rare skills at the receiver position over the past decade. Jeudy joined Cooper as a Biletnikoff Award winner after a strong sophomore season where he earned consensus first-team All-American notice and a first-team All-SEC selection. He ranked third in the FBS with 14 receiving touchdowns, catching 68 passes for 1,315 yards (19.3 per) in 15 games (14 starts). While he didn't grab all of the accolades as a junior, Jeudy was among the top receivers in the country, starting all 13 games and leading the Tide with 77 receptions (1,163 yards, 15.1 per) and scoring 10 times to repeat as a first-team all-conference pick. Jeudy enrolled a semester early at Alabama in 2017 after earning second-team USA Today All-USA honors and five-star recruit rankings. He played in 14 games as a reserve his true freshman season, giving fans a glimpse of what was to come (14-264-18.9, two TDs).",6.77,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerry-jeudy/32004a45-5541-5291-9f8b-8595dc100c90
Tua Tagovailoa,"Tua Tagovailoa (pronounced TOO-uh Tongue-OH-vai-LO-uh) became a household name as a true freshman, replacing Tide starter Jalen Hurts at the start of the second half of the 2017 National Championship Game to lead the team to a comeback victory (14 of 24, 166 yards, three TD, INT). As a follow-up, Tagovailoa won the Maxwell Award and Walter Camp Player of the Year awards in 2018, along with SEC Offensive Player of the Year and second-team Associated Press All-American honors. He started all 15 games, completing 69 percent of his passes (245 of 355) for 3,966 yards, 43 TDs and six INTS. His junior season was cut to nine starts (180 of 252, 71.4 percent completion rate, 2,840 yards, 33 TDs, three INTs) as he fought through an ankle issue and then suffered a hip injury that ended his season but was not considered career-threatening. It was no surprise that Tagovailoa starred early in his career in Tuscaloosa. The Hawaii High School Player of the Year in 2016 (3,932 yards, 43 passing TDs) and son of an American Samoan father was a five-star recruit and the top dual-threat quarterback nationally, as well as the MVP of the Elite 11 competition.",6.77,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tua-tagovailoa/32005441-4762-0344-3a46-269f5e5e854e
C.J. Henderson,"C.J. (stands for Chris Jr.) Henderson is a Miami native who decided to go north to join the Gators after initially committing to the Hurricanes.

Henderson was a second-team All-SEC pick in that season, starting all 13 games as a sophomore (38 tackles, five tackles for loss, three sacks, two interceptions, seven pass breakups and two forced fumbles). He was a first-team All-SEC selection in 2019 as he led his squad with 11 pass breakups (also making 33 tackles, three for loss) despite playing in just nine regular-season games due to an ankle injury. Henderson also skipped the team's bowl game to stay healthy and prepare for the draft.

Ruggs started all 15 games as a sophomore, ranking second in the SEC with 11 receiving touchdowns and grabbing 46 passes for 741 yards overall (16.1 per).

Patrick Queen,"LSU is becoming a haven for pro linebacker prospects, with Devin White, Kwon Alexander and Deion Jones going from Baton Rouge to the NFL in recent drafts. Queen is next in line. He got a chance to start four of the last five contests as a sophomore in 2018, once due to White's unavailability in the first half against Alabama due to a questionable targeting call. In 13 games overall, Queen made 40 tackles, five for loss, and one sack. He saved his best for last, leading the squad with nine tackles, two for loss, against UCF in the Fiesta Bowl. Queen continued that progress in the team's national championship campaign, starting 12 of 15 games played and posting 85 stops, 12 tackles for loss, three sacks, an interception and two pass breakups. The former four-star recruit and 2016 Warrick Dunn award finalist (top player in the Baton Rouge area) was the first player from his hometown of Livonia to receive an LSU scholarship offer.

His best fit was on defense, though, with the Badgers so he contributed there as a reserve linebacker his redshirt freshman season (15 tackles, 3.5 for loss in 12 games). Baun's progress was set back by a foot injury suffered in 2017 preseason camp but he made up for lost time by starting all 13 games in 2018 (63 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks, one interception). Baun became a superstar in college football as a senior, finishing among the nation's leaders with 19.5 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks among his 76 total tackles to earn second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten honors.

Kinlaw started 12 games in 2018, sharing the team's Defensive MVP award (38 tackles, 10 for loss, 4.5 sacks, five pass breakups). He missed the Belk Bowl, however, as he recovered from hip surgery. Kinlaw reached his potential as a senior, earning first-team Associated Press All-America and first-team All-SEC honors even though his defensive production (35 tackles, six sacks in 12 starts) did not exactly match how dominant he was at times.",6.5,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javon-kinlaw/32004b49-4e70-8236-d068-74d6202e4019

Jordan Elliott,"Elliott is from Missouri City, Texas, making it quite a coincidence that he decided to transfer from Austin to Columbia after his freshman season. The top-100 national recruit from Westside High School played in six games as a reserve with the Longhorns in 2016 (eight tackles, 1.5 for loss), missing six games due to an MCL injury. He said he was not happy wearing burnt orange, however, so he joined his former Texas defensive line coach (Brick Haley) at Mizzou. Elliott redshirted the 2017 season, earning the team's Defensive Scout Player of the Year award. He then became a playmaker in his sophomore campaign despite not starting (24 tackles, eight for loss, three sacks in 13 games).

He looked like a future NFL starter while earning second-team All-Mountain West honors for the Aggies in 2018. Love ranked eighth in the FBS with 32 touchdown passes in 13 starts (267 of 417, 64.0 completion percentage, school single-season record 3,567 yards, six interceptions).

Love showed glimpses of his talent as a redshirt sophomore in 2017, starting six of 12 games played (129 of 235, 54.9 completion percentage, 1,631 yards, eight touchdowns, six interceptions).

A.J. Terrell,"Terrell is hoping to be the ninth corner drafted from Clemson since 2010, ranking among the top programs in the country. It is no surprise Terrell has thrived with the Tigers, as he was a five-star recruit and top-15 overall prospect after excelling for Atlanta's Westlake High School. He played a role as a key reserve on Clemson's defense as a true freshman, posting 15 tackles, intercepting one pass, and breaking up seven others. Stepping into a starting spot for all 15 games of the team's 2018 national championship season, Terrell earned third-team All-ACC honors (54 tackles, two for loss, seven pass breakups, two forced fumbles). His biggest play of the year was his third and final interception, which he returned 44 yards for a touchdown against Alabama in the title game.

Antoine Winfield Jr.,"The son of former Jim Thorpe Award winner and three-time NFL All-Pro cornerback Antoine Winfield Sr. somehow only gained three-star recruit status after his career at The Woodlands High School in Texas. He stepped into the starting lineup at safety for the Gophers in nine games as a true freshman, recording 52 stops, 2.5 for loss, four pass breakups and an interception (which he returned for an 82-yard score). Winfield's next two seasons ended in eerily similar fashions. He started the first four games of the 2017 (20 tackles, sack, two pass breakups, one blocked kick) and 2018 (17 tackles, one interception) seasons, and then missed the rest of each campaign with hamstring and foot injuries, respectively. The injuries happened against Maryland each year, as well. Healthy for all 13 starts in 2019, Winfield excelled. He was a first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten selection after leading Minnesota with 88 tackles (3.5 for loss, three sacks) and seven interceptions (returning one for a score).

Davidson also blocked three kicks during the year, tying for second in the FBS. Davidson made his return count, grabbing first-team All-SEC honors as a senior after tying Derrick Brown for the team lead with 12.5 tackles for loss and topping his squad with 7.5 sacks (also posting 48 tackles and two fumbles). The Greenville, Alabama, native was a USA Today All-American before heading to The Plains to earn SEC All-Freshman honors (38 tackles, six for loss, 2.5 sacks, four pass breakups).

Raekwon Davis,"One of the top 100 recruits of the class of 2016, Davis had to wait until after the first week of his freshman season to find out whether he would be academically eligible to play for the Tide. He got the go-ahead, then contributed in seven games as a reserve (four tackles, one sack) that season. Davis became a playmaker as a sophomore, garnering first-team All-SEC honors by posting 69 tackles, 10 for loss, and a team-high 8.5 sacks in 14 games (six starts). He became a star nationwide during Alabama's title run in 2017, making 10 tackles, two sacks, and an interception in the team's two playoff wins.  Davis' production went down a bit during his junior season (55 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks in 15 games, 14 starts) so he decided to return to the Tide for the 2019 season.

Watt), scored over 1,000 career points in basketball and won back-to-back state discus throw titles. Hawkeyes coaches put their highly regarded recruit in the rotation as a true freshman, and he recorded 15 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks in 13 games. Epenesa did not start any games in his sophomore season, either, behind veterans Parker Hesse and Anthony Nelson. He still garnered second-team All-Big Ten honors, though, by leading the Big Ten with 10.5 sacks and topping Iowa's defense with 16.5 tackles for loss (among 37 total) and four forced fumbles.

Initially offered a scholarship by South Carolina when he was 13 years old, he was so excited to get on campus that he enrolled in January 2016. Edwards recovered from that knee injury in time to participate in spring drills, giving him experience that helped him start 12 games and become a Freshman All-American and SEC All-Freshman selection, catching 44 passes for 590 yards (13.4 per) and four scores. He finished that season with a strong performance against South Florida (six receptions, 71 yards, 11.8 average, one touchdown) in the Birmingham Bowl.

An ACL tear forced him to redshirt his first year at Happy Valley but he was healthy enough in 2018 to start all 13 games and garner honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a receiver (42 receptions, 754 yards, 18.0 average, five touchdowns) and returner (20 kick returns, 523 yards, 26.2 average; 14 punt returns, 96 yards, 6.9 average). Hamler was also a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as the most versatile player in the country. He started all 13 games as a sophomore, as well, receiving second-team all-conference recognition as a receiver (56 receptions, 904 yards, 16.1 average, eight touchdowns) and honorable mention notice as a returner (24 kick returns, 513 yards, 21.4 average, 23 punt returns, 126 yards, 5.5 average).",6.33,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kj-hamler/32004841-4d38-6186-eea5-110d32b9644c
Denzel Mims,"Mims' family reunions are stacked with former football players. Three of his brothers played high school football. His cousin, David Mims II, played cornerback at Texas State, and David's father, David, was a running back for Baylor. Another cousin, Keyarris Garrett, led the nation in receiving yards as a senior and was signed by Carolina as an undrafted free agent. Mims built an impressive resume at Daingerfield High School in Texas, including earning honorable mention All-State honors in football, District MVP honors in basketball and winning the Class 3A 200-meter state title as a junior. He became Baylor's next ""big thing"" at receiver in his sophomore season, as Big 12 coaches voted him second-team all-conference after he started 11 of 12 games played and caught 61 passes for 1,087 yards (17.8 per catch) and eight touchdowns. Mims had a huge outing against Oklahoma that year, grabbing 11 throws for 192 yards and three scores. He did not see many passes his freshman year (four catches for 24 yards and 6.0 yards per catch in 11 games) due to the presence of talented players like KD Cannon and Ish Zamora ahead of him on the depth chart. His production dropped as the Bears took a step back in 2018 (55 catches, 794 receiving yards, 14.4 yards per catch), but he still managed a team-high eight receiving scores in 12 games with 10 starts. The Bears were back in 2019, partially because Mims was again torching opponents (66 catches, 1,020 receiving yards, 15.5 yards per catch, 12 receiving TDs in 14 starts) on his way to first-team all-conference honors.",6.33,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/denzel-mims/32004d49-4d62-4399-5aee-b92ce1fc40e6

He was even more productive as a sophomore, garnering second-team all-conference accolades with a team-high 119 tackles , eight for loss, one interception, and two forced fumbles in 13 starts. Wilson led his squad in tackles again in 2018 (103) as well as tackles for loss (11) while intercepting two passes and breaking up two others on his way to honorable mention All-MWC honors. He was a first-team all-conference pick as a senior and was also named third-team Associated Press All-American for his efforts (104 tackles, 9.5 for loss, one sack, three interceptions, six pass breakups in 13 starts).",6.33,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/logan-wilson/32005749-4c74-7370-743f-2000a41bbeba

He played in 12 games his first year in Boca Raton, landing on the Conference USA All-Freshman team (six receptions, 63 yards, 10.5 average). Bryant attacked the ball as a sophomore, bringing in 32 passes for 408 yards (12.8 per) and five scores in 11 games (10 starts) to earn second-team all-conference honors. His production increased again as a junior (45 receptions, 662 yards, 14.7 per, four touchdowns), allowing him to become a first-team All-C-USA pick. Bryant not only repeated his first-team all-conference selection in 2019, he earned first-team Associated Press All-American honors and won the John Mackey Award as the nation's top tight end. He led all tight ends nationally with 65 receptions for 1,004 yards (15.4 per) while scoring seven times in 12 starts.

Chase Claypool,"Claypool grew up in British Columbia and was not getting much attention from American colleges until he started posting highlights on Facebook. Eventually he became a top-20 receiver prospect and landed a spot in South Bend. Claypool actually had more special teams tackles (eight) than receptions (five catches, 81 yards, 16.2 average) in 12 games as a true freshman -- but that's a good thing for a young player making his mark.

Claypool became a household name in 13 starts during the 2019 campaign, as he was the team's leading receiver, grabbing 66 passes for 1,037 yards (15.7 per) and 13 touchdowns, which ranked in the top 10 nationally.",6.32,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chase-claypool/3200434c-4178-1009-34a1-bfb9899e5d84
Lloyd Cushenberry,"For the past 15 years, LSU has given the No. 18 jersey to players that displayed a selfless attitude and played like a Tiger.

Cushenberry was the first offensive lineman to earn the coveted number in 2019, sharing the honor with defender K'Lavon Chaisson, though NCAA rules required Cushenberry to stick with his 79 jersey (he displayed an 18 patch on his jersey). He wore that badge of honor well as a junior, garnering first-team All-SEC notice and leading the Joe Moore Award-winning offensive line for all 15 games of the Bayou Bengals' national title run. He started all 13 games at center as a sophomore in 2018, one season after contributing as a reserve lineman and on special teams in 11 contests his redshirt freshman campaign.

Malik Harrison,"Harrison was a top-50 ATH recruit nationally after starting for three years at quarterback for Columbus' Walnut Ridge High School.

Harrison played in 12 games as a reserve his true freshman season (13 tackles), and then in 14 games with a start against Michigan State in 2017 (36 tackles, three for loss, 1.5 sacks). Big Ten coaches named him honorable mention All-Big Ten as a junior, tying for the Buckeyes' lead with 81 tackles (8.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks, interception). Harrison again proved himself a playmaker for the Buckeyes as a senior, garnering third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten notice as the team's leading tackler (75 stops, 16.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, four pass breakups in 14 starts).",6.26,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malik-harrison/32004841-5260-5109-5b0d-c966f8ba7e71

Grant Delpit,"Jamal Adams, LaRon Landry, Tyrann Mathieu, Eric Reid -- what do these NFL starting safeties have in common? They're all former LSU Tigers. Delpit is the next in line to head to the professional ranks. He does not shrink from the comparisons, requesting to wear the No. 7 jersey previously worn by Mathieu, cornerback Patrick Peterson and running back Leonard Fournette. In 2017, Delpit played like the four-star recruit that he was out of IMG Academy (he played three years at Lamar High School in Houston), starting 10 of 13 games played as a true freshman (60 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one interception, eight pass breakups). He became a household name in 2018, when he was the ninth player in LSU history to be named a unanimous first-team All-American and first-team All-SEC selection with 74 tackles (9.5 for loss, five sacks), a conference-high five interceptions and nine pass breakups. Delpit's reputation helped him win the Jim Thorpe Award as well as second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference honors in 2019. He posted 65 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks, two interceptions and seven pass breakups in 14 starts for the national champs.

Jacob Eason,"Eason was the top pro-style high school quarterback recruit coming out of Lake Stevens High School in the Seattle area.

As a true freshman, he grabbed the starting job in 12 of 13 games played, completing 204-of-370 throws (55.1 percent) for 2,430 yards and 16 scores with eight interceptions. Eason was the starter to begin the 2017 season, as well, but left the Bulldogs' opener with a left knee injury. Freshman Jake Fromm took over the starting duties for the rest of the year. Eason played in five games in total in 2018 (4 of 7, 57.1 percent completion rate, 28 yards passing), then decided to transfer back to his home state.

His versatility earned him the Paul Hornung Award as the nation's most outstanding all-purpose player, as well as first-team Associated Press All-American all-purpose recognition. Bowden rushed for 1,468 yards (185 carries, 7.9 per) and 13 touchdowns while also leading the Wildcats in receiving (30-348-11.6, one TD in five starts to begin the year) and contributing as a returner (4-53-13.2 on punts, 9-220-24.4 on kickoffs) to finish in the top five nationally in all-purpose yards. He apologized for his role in a pre-game skirmish with Virginia Tech players prior to the 2019 Belk Bowl. Bowden was a second-team All-SEC pick as an all-purpose performer in 2018, leading the team in receiving (67-745-11.1, five TDs), starring as a returner (25-539-21.6 kickoff returns; 5-146-29.9, two punt returns for TDs -- tied for first nationally) and starting 12 of 13 games played.

Jeremy Chinn,"Colleges overlooked Chinn because he was not 100 percent healthy his junior year, when recruiters are performing their due diligence. He was an All-Metro pick in the Indianapolis area as a senior, though, which landed him at SIU. Missouri Valley Football Conference coaches voted him to their All-Newcomer team in 2016 (51 tackles, three interceptions, two pass breakups, six starts in eight games), even though he missed the first three games of the year with a dislocated shoulder. Chinn started all 11 games the following season, garnering second-team all-conference honors (66 tackles, three interceptions, six pass breakups) and tying for fourth in the FCS with four forced fumbles. He was a first-team All-MVFC pick as a junior, intercepting three passes for the third consecutive year and posting 55 tackles, seven pass breakups, and two forced fumbles.

He followed that up with a 45-tackle (6.5 for loss), three-sack campaign in 2019. Strowbridge was a starter as a sophomore, posting 34 tackles, 5.5 for loss, and a sack.

Gipson did not see the field too often as a redshirt freshman (eight tackles, one sack in 13 games) and sophomore (11 tackles, one forced fumble) but stepped up his game in 2018. He started all 12 games for the Golden Hurricanes as a junior, racking up 46 tackles, nine for loss, and four sacks while tying for second in the FBS with five forced fumbles. Gipson was even more productive as a senior, garnering first-team All-American Athletic Conference accolades by leading Tulsa with 15 tackles for loss and eight sacks among his 49 total stops (also posting two forced fumbles in 12 games with 11 starts).",6.22,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevis-gipson/32004749-5056-4972-92bf-717d307ebaac

LSU signed him in 2018 to take over the same spot on the line, and Lewis suited up for all 13 games.

Greenard went through a rough year in 2018, first suffering a season-ending right wrist injury in the opener and then deciding to transfer from Louisville to Florida as a graduate student once Cardinals head coach Bobby Petrino was fired. The 2018 team captain showed great promise in 2017, leading the Cards in tackles for loss (15.5 among 48 total stops) and sacks (seven) and starting five of 13 games played.

He did play in all 13 games his freshman year, however, starting nine at three different positions (seven at left tackle, one at right tackle, one at right guard) to garner SEC All-Freshman Team honors.

He earned second-team All-Pac-12 accolades at cornerback as a sophomore and junior, starting all 27 games. Blackmon led the Utes with four interceptions in 2017 while also posting 48 tackles and six pass breakups. The following season, he again posted 48 stops, four for loss, an interception, and a team-high 10 pass breakups.

Isaiah Hodgins,"Hodgins is the son of longtime NFL fullback James Hodgins, who helped Marshall Faulk earn Hall of Fame accolades with the Rams' ""Greatest Show or Turf.""  He was an all-state receiver in California before going to Corvallis, where he got on the field right away for the Beavers (31-275-8.9, two TDs in 11 games, six starts). Hodgins really began to fulfill his great promise as a sophomore, garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors as OSU's leading receiver (59-876-14.8, five TDs in 11 games, nine starts). He became a known quantity across the country in 2019 after snatching 86 passes for 1,171 yards (13.6 per) and 13 touchdowns.

Jalen Hurts,"Hurts, a Houston native, was rated the No. 1 dual-threat quarterback in the country after starring at Channelview High School, where his father served as head coach. He signed with Alabama and led the Tide to the national championship game, starting 14 games and earning Freshman All-American, first-team All-SEC, SEC Freshman of the Year, and Maxwell Award finalist honors (204 of 382, 62.8 completion percentage, 2,780 yards, 23 touchdowns, nine interceptions; set a school record for a quarterback with 954 rushing yards, 13 touchdowns). He started all 14 games for head coach Nick Saban in 2017, again leading the team to the national championship game (154 of 255, 60.4 completion percentage, 2,081 yards, 17 touchdowns, one interception; 154 carries, 855 yards, 5.6 ypc, eight touchdowns). He was replaced by freshman Tua Tagovailoa in the second half of the team's title game victory over Clemson, however. In 2018, Tua took the starting job from Hurts, who played in 13 games as a reserve (51 of 70, 72.9 completion percentage, 765 yards, eight touchdowns, two interceptions; 36 rushes, 167 yards, 4.6 ypc, two touchdowns) but turned the tables when Tagovailoa was injured in the fourth quarter of the 2018 SEC Championship Game, leading the Tide to a comeback win (7 of 9, 82 yards, passing touchdown, rushing touchdown). Hurts decided to transfer from Alabama to Oklahoma as a graduate student for 2019 and interestingly, has the same birth date (Aug. 7) as the quarterback that he replaced at OU, Kyler Murray. He did not disappoint during his lone year in Norman, leading the team to Big 12 title and playoff appearances while garnering third-team Associated Press All-American Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors. Hurts was also named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award after ranking second to Heisman winner Joe Burrow in passing efficiency by completing 69.7 percent of his passes (237 of 340) for 3,851 yards and 32 touchdowns with eight interceptions in 14 starts. He also led the Sooners in rushing with 1,298 yards (233 carries, 5.6 per) while running for 20 touchdowns, which ranked in the top 10 nationally, and caught two passes for 25 yards (12.5 per) and a score.",6.14,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-hurts/32004855-5276-7022-85cf-a74490936f42
Matt Peart,"Peart's (pronounced PAYRT) family moved from Kingston, Jamaica to The Bronx in New York City when he was four years old. Growing up in the city, he focused on basketball until heading to Governor's Academy in Massachusetts for high school. Once there, coaches made sure he played football before basketball season began (he was a team captain for the hoops team). UConn saw his potential as a tackle, so it signed him and sat him in the 2015 season so he could get stronger. Adding 40 pounds, he started every game of the 2016 season at left tackle. Peart played there again in 2017, and then moved to the right side for his junior year.

Gandy-Golden lit up the Big South Conference the previous year, garnering a first-team nod (69 receptions, 1,066 yards, 15.4 average, 10 touchdowns).

Willie Gay Jr.,"Gay looked to be on the upswing after a promising sophomore campaign in which he posted 48 stops, 5.5 for loss, five sacks and two interceptions in 13 games with six starts. He was limited to playing in five games as a reserve (28 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one interception, one pass breakup) during his junior year, though, as he was held out of eight contests due to NCAA violations pertaining to an academic tutor. Reportedly, Gay and starting quarterback Garrett Shrader got into an altercation late in the year. Gay was a top-50 overall recruit who led Starkville High School to a state title before committing to his hometown school.

He played in 14 games as a reserve in 2017, scoring four touchdowns on 10 catches (97 yards, 9.7 per). The departure of Dalton Schultz to the NFL gave Parkinson a chance to team with Kaden Smith in the Cardinal's two-tight end sets as a sophomore. Pac-12 coaches named him honorable mention all-conference after he caught 29 passes for 485 yards (16.7 per) and seven touchdowns.

He started 10 of 13 games played that season, leading his squad with seven sacks and three forced fumbles while tying for the team lead with 10 tackles for loss among his 39 total stops. Pac-12 coaches voted Anae first-team all-conference in 2018 after he led the league with eight sacks among his 51 tackles, 15.5 for loss. He also broke up three passes and forced two fumbles as a junior. Anae repeated his first-team All-Pac-12 nod in 2019 and added third-team Associated Press All-American notice to the list after leading the Utes with 14 tackles for loss among his 41 total stops in 14 starts, 13 of which were sacks.",6.12,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bradlee-anae/3200414e-4116-6115-7bc0-5ac560a62693

Benjamin became the Sun Devils' bell-cow back as a sophomore, carrying the mail a school-record 300 times for 1,642 yards (5.5 per) and 16 touchdowns. The third-team Associated Press All-American, first-team All-Pac-12 selection, and team MVP ranked fifth in the country in rushing yards, ninth in touchdowns.

Nick Harris,"Though Harris was considered a top-15 center prospect nationally, Washington was the only FBS school to offer him a scholarship. He played for former USC and NFL offensive lineman Pat Harlow, which should have been a good sign to schools looking for a solid interior starter. Harris made an impact as a true freshman, starting four games (two at left guard, two at right guard) for the Huskies. He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick in 2017, starting all 13 games at right guard. His coaches moved him to the pivot for his junior season, and he wound up starting all 13 games and garnering first-team all-conference honors for his efforts.

He played well in 2018, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten notice with 40 tackles, an interception, six pass breakups in 13 starts. Arnette was a fixture in the Buckeyes' secondary as a sophomore, as well, recording 44 stops, three for loss, two interceptions, and eight pass breakups.

The Terrapins offered him just before signing day and haven't regretted it since. He played in six games as a reserve his true freshman season (five tackles), and then moved from linebacker to defensive back.

Briles was let go before Duvernay arrived, however, and Baylor never submitted his National Letter of Intent to the NCAA. So the first-team all-state pick in football and 2015 100-meter state champion moved on to Austin. Duvernay made an instant impact, starting two of 12 games played, tying for the team lead with three receiving touchdowns (20 receptions, 412 yards, 20.6 average), and contributing as a kick returner (12 returns, 257 yards, 21.4 average). He did not provide as much production in his sophomore campaign (nine receptions, 124 yards, 13.8 average; four returns, 88 yards, 22.0 average on kick returns in 13 games, one start) but bounced back as a junior with 41 receptions for 546 yards (13.3 per) and four scores in 14 starts.

Jackson joined Syracuse before the 2018 season and sat out the regular season due to NCAA transfer regulations. A new rule allowed him to participate in bowl practices and the game, however, when he caught three passes for 27 yards and a score. Jackson became the Orange's top receiving threat in 2019, covering 1,023 yards and scoring 11 times on 66 receptions (15.5 per) in 12 games (11 starts) to earn second-team All-ACC recognition.

Netane Muti,"Netane Muti (pronounced nuh-than-EE MOO-tee) was born in Tonga but was an all-state offensive and defensive lineman in Hawaii. Injuries have really limited his ability to put up a strong college resume, however. He redshirted the 2016 season with an Achilles injury, played just the first two games of 2018 at left tackle before rupturing an Achilles, and then started just three games at left guard before a Lisfranc (foot) injury ended his 2019 season.

As a redshirt freshman in 2017, ""Chuks"" was a second-team All-SEC and SEC All-Freshman team pick after scoring 11 times on 29 catches that covered 415 yards (14.3 per). He started the first nine games of his sophomore season, catching 43 passes for 466 yards (10.8) and six touchdowns, but missed the final four contests with a shoulder injury.

He still garnered second-team All-SEC notice, however, by scoring a team-high six receiving touchdowns on the year (26-306-11.8).

Josiah Scott,"Scott excelled as an honorable mention All-Big Ten junior corner for the Spartans, leading his squad with three interceptions and eight pass breakups in 13 starts. He overcame a knee injury that cost him the first eight games of the 2018 season to earn the RedBox Bowl Defensive MVP Award (three tackles, one for loss, four pass breakups) in the Spartans' 7-6 loss to Oregon. Scott started only five games on the year but still intercepted two passes and broke up seven others (along with making 13 tackles). He was an honorable mention all-conference pick as a true freshman, starting all 12 games and breaking up 12 passes (30 stops, two interceptions).

Alex Taylor,"Taylor was a star basketball player at Berkeley High School in South Carolina, only playing 17 games of football. He had the genes to play, however, with his uncle, Joe Hamilton, starring at quarterback for Georgia Tech and his uncle, Pierson Prioleau, excelling as a defensive back at Virginia Tech and in the NFL for over a decade. Taylor's father, Patrick, also played college football (Presbyterian). Appalachian State decided to take a chance on Taylor's athleticism and family lineage. He redshirted in 2015 and played in just four games as a reserve the next season. South Carolina State gave him a shot to play basketball, so he transferred before the 2017-2018 school year. Taylor played a bit as a backup that year and as a junior, but his decision to return to the gridiron in the fall of 2018 proved to be a good one. He was a third-team all-Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference selection after starting all 11 games at right tackle for the Gamecocks.

He started all 13 games as a junior and led his squad with 115 tackles (nine for loss, 5.5 sacks, one interception). Bailey's senior season was short-circuited by a knee injury (14 tackles, two for loss, one sack in four starts). Bailey started 13 games as a sophomore (89 stops, 11 for loss, seven sacks, one interception) and led Purdue with 97 tackles (six for loss) and four interceptions as a redshirt freshman.

Ben Bredeson,"Despite growing up less than an hour from Camp Randall and winning Wisconsin's Gatorade Player of the Year award and Joe Thomas Award as the state's top offensive lineman as a senior, Bredeson eschewed the Badgers to sign with Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh. His talent was too strong to keep off the field, and he earned Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Big Ten notice after starting eight of 13 games played in 2016. Bredeson started all 12 games at left guard in 2017, garnering second-team all-conference honors. He was named a team captain in 2018, starting all 13 games at left guard and earning a second-team All-Big Ten nod.

He received those same accolades as a sophomore in 2017, making 30 catches for 501 yards (16.7 per) and six scores in nine games (eight starts). Cephus missed the end of the season with a right leg injury.

In fact, he walked on at Charlotte, redshirting in 2015 before gaining playing time the next year (17 tackles, two for losses, one start in 12 games). While he was a reserve player in 2017, Highsmith received a scholarship before the season and made an impact on the field, recording 33 stops, five for losses, and two sacks as a pass rush specialist. His game matured in 2018, garnering first-team All-Conference USA accolades by posting 60 tackles, a school-record 17.5 tackles for loss, three sacks and two forced fumbles.

Johnson missed the final two games of his sophomore campaign with a hand injury but still earned honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades (35-677-19.3, seven TDs in 10 games). A healthy junior season led to school records in receiving yards and touchdowns (78-1,169-15.0, 12 TDs), as well as first-team all-conference honors.

In 2017, Proche displayed nice playmaking skills while starting nine of 13 games played (40 catches for 816 yards, 20.4 yards per catch and six TDs). He pushed his game to another level as a junior, being named first-team All-American Athletic Conference as SMU's leading receiver, grabbing 93 passes for 1,199 yards (12.9 yards per catch) and 12 scores. He again was the team's primary returner in 2018 (12 returns for 276 yards and a 23.0-yard average on kickoffs; 20 returns for 165 yards and an 8.3-yard average on punts).

Nate Stanley,"When Stanley's home-state Wisconsin Badgers passed on him even though he excelled in multiple sports at Menomonie High School, signing with Iowa seemed a good fit. He spent his first year in Iowa City on the bench, getting limited time in seven games (5 of 9, 54.5 completion percentage, 62 yards). Stanley took over the starting job his sophomore year, completing 55.8 percent of his throws (196 of 351) for 2,437 yards and 26 scores (just six interceptions). He improved his accuracy as a 13-game starter again his junior season (325 of 396, 59.3 completion percentage, 2,852 yards, 26 touchdowns, 10 interceptions). Stanley, a three-time team captain, was a honorable mention All-Big Ten pick as a 13-game starter in 2019 after setting a career high with 2,941 passing yards (237 of 399, 59.4 completion percentage, 16 touchdowns, seven interceptions).",5.93,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-stanley/32005354-4145-5349-7970-b78efc9c00c7

He was a first-team All-Sun Belt Conference selection in 2018, posting 42 stops, 4.5 for loss, a team-high four interceptions and 11 pass breakups in 13 starts. His follow-up performance was just as strong, as SBC coaches named him first-team all-conference again in 2019 despite missing time with an ankle injury (27 tackles, three for loss, two interceptions, six pass breakups in 11 games, 10 starts). Vildor became a part-time starter in 2017, beginning five of 12 contests played (21 tackles, 1.5 for loss, three interceptions, seven pass breakups).

He played in 15 games for Clemson as a reserve during his freshman season (six tackles, one interception) before earning six starts in 14 games as a sophomore (36 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups). Wallace stepped up his game in the Tigers' 2018 national championship season, garnering honorable mention All-ACC notice after starting all 15 games and posting 55 tackles, 1.5 for loss, an interception, seven pass breakups, and two forced fumbles.

Rashard Lawrence,"LSU made a big signing when keeping this Monroe native in-state as one of the top 20 recruits in the country. Lawrence flashed as a freshman, playing in nine games and sacking Louisville's Heisman Trophy winning-quarterback Lamar Jackson in the Citrus Bowl. Lawrence was a team captain as a sophomore, missing time with ankle injuries but starting 10 games, including the final eight (32 tackles, 3.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks). He started all 13 games as a junior (54 tackles, 10.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, three pass breakups) and finished the year on a high note as the Fiesta Bowl Defensive Player of the Game with four tackles for loss (two sacks) in the team's win over UCF. Lawrence missed spring drills in 2019 after having surgery on his right knee. He wound up playing in 12 games (11 starts) his senior season, missing time due to an ankle injury but still earning second-team All-SEC notice after posting 28 tackles, six for loss, 2.5 sacks, and three pass breakups during the Tigers' national championship campaign.",5.92,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashard-lawrence/32004c41-5749-4873-c7c3-250e8db8cc3b

He earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors for his efforts on offense (he also had nine receptions, 55 yards, 6.1 average) and took home the conference's Return Specialist of the Year award after ranking third in the FBS with 804 kickoff return yards (on 30 attempts), scoring two times. Leake also returned kicks as a freshman (13 returns, 274 yards, 21.1 average) and sophomore (14 returns, 359 yards, 25.6 average, one touchdown). His carries from the backfield were limited (nine carries, 99 yards, 11.0 ypc, two touchdowns in 2017; 23 carries, 275 yards, 12.0 ypc, seven touchdowns in 2018) despite his explosiveness with the ball in his hands.

Isaiah Rodgers,"Slender, ballhawking cornerback who will need to prove he can make a move from outside into the slot at the next level. He has blazing closing speed on long throws with plus ball skills to play the football and constrict catch space. His twitch and instincts allow him to pounce on top of throws from off-man but his slight frame could be an issue when teams target him with bigger bodies in coverage. He's a plus return man, which adds to his value, but his success could rest upon how he handles a transition inside and whether his body can hold up in run support.",5.92,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-rodgers/3200524f-4436-8010-e65e-c67817074ab0
JaMycal Hasty,"Hasty was an honorable mention all-state pick as a junior running back at Longview High School in Texas but missed most of his senior season with a stress fracture in his back. Baylor signed him anyway and let him heal with a redshirt year in 2015. Despite not starting in his first year on the field, he managed 119 carries for 623 yards (5.2 per) and three scores on the ground in 12 games in 2016 (three receptions, 26 yards, 8.7 average; eight kick returns, 160 yards, 20.0 average). Injuries struck him again in 2017, though, limiting him to eight games (76 carries, 314 yards, 4.1 ypc, one touchdown; 25 receptions, 105 yards, 4.2 average in three starts). Healthy as a junior, Hasty started 10 of 11 games (82 carries, 434 yards, 5.3 ypc, four touchdowns; 26 receptions, 170 yards, 6.5 average, one touchdown). He got more work as a senior, garnering honorable mention All-Big 12 honors for the Bears and started three of 14 games (109 carries, 627 yards, 5.8 ypc, seven touchdowns; 25 receptions, 184 yards, 7.4 average; six kick returns, 118 yards, 19.7 average).",5.91,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamycal-hasty/32004841-5376-6320-3668-fe378d3d0a54
Kendall Hinton,"Hinton came to Winston-Salem as a three-star dual-threat quarterback throwing for over 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns as a senior to earn a spot on the Raleigh News & Observer All-Metro squad. He started twice at quarterback for Wake for injured starter John Wolford as a true freshman in 2015 (93 of 179, 52.0 completion percentage, 929 yards, four touchdowns, five interceptions; 93 carries, 390 yards, 4.2 average, seven touchdowns). Hinton redshirted the 2016 season after suffering a knee injury in the third game (11 of 19, 57.9 completion percentage, 174 yards, one interception; 25 carries, 125 yards, 5.0 average, two touchdowns) and played as a backup passer in five games in 2017 (27 of 47, 57.4 completion percentage; 46 carries, 190 yards, 4.1 average, one touchdown). Hinton moved from quarterback to receiver during his junior campaign, catching six passes for 61 yards (10.2 per) and contributing as a quarterback in three games (2 of 8, 25.0 completion percentage, two yards, one interception; 22 carries, 167 yards, 7.6 average, two touchdowns). He was suspended for the first three games of the year for a violation of team rules. Hinton nearly transferred from Wake before the team's bowl game in 2018 but instead blew up the learning curve at receiver his senior year, earning third-team All-ACC honors in 11 starts, leading the Deacs in receiving with 73 receptions for 1,001 yards and four scores, missing two games due to injury.",5.91,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kendall-hinton/32004849-4e74-6231-69c6-0e70f3bcbc44
Colton McKivitz,"Mountaineers coaches managed to pull McKivitz out of Ohio, where he was a first-team all-state pick in football and basketball as a senior. As a redshirt freshman, he earned 10 starts at tackle and played in 13 games overall. The next two seasons, McKivitz was named honorable mention All-Big 12 by league coaches after starting all 25 contests for WVU.  Even though the Mountaineers' offensive performance in 2019 was disappointing, McKivitz's play in 12 starts at left tackle was recognized by the Associated Press (third-team All-American) and conference coaches (second-team All-Big 12).",5.91,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/colton-mckivitz/32004d43-4b69-7746-902f-ec9dd1066991
Jared Pinkney,"Pinkney helped Norcross High School win back-to-back Georgia state titles before signing with the Commodores. He intended to play as a true freshman, but an injury in the opener pushed him to redshirt. Pinkney played a strong role in Vandy's offense in 2016, starting six of 13 games played (22 receptions, 274 yards, 12.5 average, two touchdowns). He started nine of 12 contests the following year (22 receptions, 279 yards, 12.7 average, three touchdowns) and then became one of the top tight ends in the SEC as a junior, grabbing 50 passes for 774 yards (15.5 per) and seven scores in 13 starts. The team's offensive struggles made it difficult to reach those totals in 2019 (20 receptions, 233 yards, 11.6 average, two touchdowns in 11 starts).

Jon Runyan,"Runyan is the son of the former Michigan star and NFL Pro Bowl right tackle of the same name. The older Runyan served in the U.S. House of Representatives for two terms and is currently an NFL Vice President of Policy and Rules Administration. The younger Runyan appears to be headed for a long NFL career of his own. The Moorestown, New Jersey, native actually played his high school football at St. Joseph's in Pennsylvania, earning all-state notice his senior year. Michigan signed the legacy pick, though he had to wait through a redshirt season in 2015 and made only one appearance the following year. Runyan played in nine games as a sophomore, starting for the first time in the team's Outback Bowl appearance. He ascended to first-team All-Big Ten status in 2018, starting all 13 games at left tackle.

He's been an immovable object on the right side for the Tigers over the past four years, however, garnering first-team All-ACC honors as a senior and second-team all-conference notice as a junior. He started all 15 games both seasons, helping the team win a national title in 2018 and make it to the championship game the following year. Anchrum started one of 11 games played at the position as a true freshman, coming off an all-state senior season at McEachern High School in Georgia. He started six of 14 games played as a sophomore.

Despite those accolades, he redshirted his first year at GSU, and then was limited to kickoffs and seven extra point tries (making six) in 2016. Bass garnered second-team All-Sun Belt honors as a sophomore (27 of 28 on extra points, 15 of 19 on field goals with a long of 48 yards) and first-team all-conference notice the following year (45 of 45 XPs, 19 of 21 FGs, long 50). Bass was a second-team All-SBC performer as a senior (36 of 36 XPs, 20 of 28 FGs, long 49), setting a school record with 20 field goals. He had game-winning kicks in the team's 2018 Camellia Bowl win and against South Alabama in 2019.

Rodrigo Blankenship,"Blankenship has family in Brazil, and he attended soccer camps there before turning his attention to football full-time while in high school in Marietta, Georgia. He kicked in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, but still had to fight for a scholarship from Georgia head coach Kirby Smart. Smart did not offer Blankenship a scholarship until his sophomore year -- this despite the young man earning SEC All-Freshman status in 2016 (26 of 26 on extra points, 14 of 18 on field goals) one year after redshirting. He connected on 20 of 23 field goal attempts as a sophomore (63 of 63 on extra points), including a Rose Bowl-record 55-yarder against Oklahoma. Blankenship garnered second-team All-SEC notice in 2018 after ranking 10th in the FBS with 122 points; he made all 65 point-after tries and 19 of 23 field goals (long of 53). He completed his career with the ultimate accolade, winning the Lou Groza Award as the nation's best kicker. The first-team All-SEC selection made all 46 extra point tries and 27 of 33 field goal attempts (81.8 percent), including three of five attempts from 50-plus yards. Blankenship had a rough game in the team's upset loss to South Carolina, however, having one field goal blocked and missing a 42-yard attempt that would have extended the game. Blankenship was also a very good kickoff specialist throughout his career (20 touchbacks on 55 kicks in 2016, 67 on 93 in 2017, 82 on 96 in 2018, 65 on 85 in 2019).",5.9,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rodrigo-blankenship/3200424c-4173-6676-c104-923707f16021
Raymond Calais,"Change-of-pace back with very good burst but below average size that could limit his NFL suitors. Calais is fairly talented (and courageous) as an inside/outside zone runner, but as a pro, he will likely be considered a gadget back who makes his living in open space. His play speed is what gives him a chance, but he needs to run with better patience to improve his control and elusiveness in the open field.

He also caught 27 passes for 193 yards (7.1 per). Kelley was a second-team all-conference pick in 2019, even though his numbers were down a bit in 11 starts (229 carries, 1,060 yards, 4.6 ypc, 12 touchdowns; 11 receptions, 71 yards, 6.5 average, one touchdown).",5.9,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joshua-kelley/32004b45-4c27-2420-b6d2-7125878e440b
Michael Ojemudia,"Ojemudia (pronounced oh-jay-MOO-dee-uh) has grown into a steady performer during the course of his career in Iowa City. The Farmington Hills, Michigan, native did not like playing cornerback in high school because he did not get to hit often enough. His lean build forced him outside for the Hawkeyes, however, where he played in all 13 games as a redshirt freshman (five tackles, one pass breakup). Ojemudia started three games as a sophomore (29 tackles, one pass breakup in 13 games) before breaking out as a junior. He intercepted three passes in 2018, breaking up six others and posting 39 stops in 13 games (seven starts).

The following year, Hardin started seven of eight games played (39 tackles, three for loss, two interceptions, four pass breakups) but was suspended for three games early in the season after he was among multiple Minnesota players accused of sexual assault by a woman. Hardin was not charged with a crime and returned to the team in October, but he was was suspended indefinitely in December amid a school investigation of the incident and was later expelled. He redshirted at Pittsburg State as a transfer student, then worked his way into a starting role in 2018. Hardin was a third-team All-MIAA pick as a junior (seven tackles, two interceptions, four pass breakups) even though he suffered a season-ending MCL tear after six starts. Returning for his senior season, Hardin starred again for the Gorillas as a first-team all-conference selection on defense (27 tackles, 3.5 for loss, team-high four interceptions -- one returned for a score -- and 11 pass breakups) as well as on special teams (16-230-11.4 punt returns; 4-57-14.2 kick returns).",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kiante-hardin/32004841-5205-3518-40ad-167c94775c6a
Solomon Kindley,"Kindley was a Class AAA second-team all-state pick at Jacksonville's Raines High School before moving north to Athens. The three-star recruit played in one game as a reserve in 2016 and took a redshirt. SEC coaches named him to their All-Freshman team after he started seven of 15 games played at right guard in 2017. Kindley's play as a 14-game starter at right guard his sophomore campaign gained him a share of the Bulldogs' Most Improved Player award on offense. He started 11 of 13 games played at left guard in 2019, missing some time with a lower right leg injury, and then decided to leave school for the NFL.",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/solomon-kindley/32004b49-4e19-0649-1d38-6abe795d5e75
Darnell Mooney,"Mooney was an all-state player for Gadsden High School in Alabama, but a late qualifying test score reportedly kept many programs from offering him. Tulane stepped in, and he started eight of 12 games played (24-267-11.1, two TDs) as a true freshman. He started every contest in his sophomore campaign (34-599-17.6, four TDs) and did so again in 2018, earning second-team All-AAC honors and ranking sixth in the FBS with 20.7 yards per catch (48-993, eight TDs).

Thaddeus Moss,"Moss is the son of the Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss. Thaddeus moved around quite a bit in high school, playing in five schools in four states. He was ranked among the top 10 tight end recruits in the country despite his constant transitions, signing with North Carolina State. He started three of 13 games played as a true freshman for the Wolfpack, catching six passes for 49 yards (8.2 per) and a score. Another move was on the way, though, as he transferred to LSU and sat out 2017 as a transfer student. Moss did not get a chance to play in 2018, either, as he suffered a foot injury (fifth metatarsal) before the season. He had two surgeries on that foot and rehabbed in time to play in the 2019 season. His presence in 14 starts was an immense help to Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow, as they connected 47 times for 570 yards (12.1 per) and four scores. Two of those four touchdowns came in the national title game victory over Clemson.",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/thaddeus-moss/32004d4f-5372-3035-30a4-e64d97cdc93c
Tanner Muse,"Muse was a first-team All-State defensive player and ran for over 1,200 yards his senior season at South Point High School in North Carolina. As a redshirt freshman in 2016, he received the team's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year award after posting 10 coverage tackles in 15 games (he had 19 total stops on the year). Muse moved into the starting lineup as a sophomore, beginning nine of 14 games played (57 tackles, two for loss, four pass breakups). Clemson won the national title in 2018, with Muse starting all 15 games and garnering third-team All-ACC honors (61 tackles, 2.5 for loss, two interceptions, five pass breakups). He drew third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference honors as a senior as he walloped 74 ball-carriers (six for losses, two sacks), intercepted a team-high four passes and broke up five others.",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tanner-muse/32004d55-5309-5608-cf11-ed8e106f171c
Chauncey Rivers,"Rivers was looking to become a star in the SEC as a four-star recruit out of Stone Mountain, Georgia, but he spent only one season with Georgia (four tackles in four games) before he was dimissed from the team following his third marijuana arrest in the span of seven months. He transferred to one of the schools in Netflix's ""Last Chance U"" series, East Mississippi Community College, and dominated (45 tackles, eight sacks). Mississippi State gave Rivers that second chance but he redshirted in 2017 after being ruled academically ineligible. Back on the field for his junior campaign, Rivers showed flashes of talent as a key reserve (24 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks in 13 games). He moved into the starting lineup for his senior season, leading the Bulldogs with eight tackles for loss and five sacks among his 43 total stops (also posting three pass breakups).",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chauncey-rivers/32005249-5643-7618-72e5-8964dd14fd15

An injury disrupted Robinson's junior year, however, as he played eight games (19 tackles, five pass breakups, four starts). Robinson bounced back for his senior campaign, garnering first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors after leading his squad with four interceptions and 13 pass breakups. He also posted 38 tackles, one for loss, and two fumble recoveries.

Justin Rohrwasser,"Well-built kicker who has the leg strength to handle kickoff duties and should have the power to muscle up on tries of 50-plus. While he was extremely accurate from 40-plus in 2019, that distance had been a major issue for him in previous years. His drive kicks come out without as much lift and his truncated follow-through might need some work in order to create more consistent ball flight. The 2019 results were encouraging, but he still has much to prove.",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-rohrwasser/3200524f-4867-3692-2c4c-de1a11ff9966
Terence Steele,"After his junior year of high school, Steele decided to lose weight to help his team win. Fifty pounds later, he not only became a first-team All-District player but also found himself the apple of FBS coaches' eye. He stepped into a starting role as a redshirt freshman, starting the first 10 games at left tackle before moving to the right side for the final two games. Steele started all 13 games at that spot in 2017. He was a team captain as a junior, starting all 12 games again at right tackle. Big 12 coaches named him honorable mention All-Big 12 his senior season, as he started 10 games at right tackle after missing the first two due to an upper-body injury suffered during the summer.",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terence-steele/32005354-4506-8762-2112-8a35d38bedbd
Freddie Swain,"The two-time all-state pick from Ocala, Florida, earned a role on offense as a true freshman for the Gators, playing in all 13 games (8-118-14.8, two TDs). He played through a torn labrum in his shoulder and had surgery after the season. Swain started four games in 2017, though his production was limited (8-96-12.0, four TDs in 11 games). He had one of the biggest plays of the year for Florida, catching a game-winning touchdown against Kentucky to finish off a big comeback win. Swain was given the chance to make more plays as a junior, catching 14 passes for 265 yards (18.9 average) and five scores in 11 games off the bench. He started 6 of 12 games played as a senior, leading the Gators with seven receiving touchdowns (38-517-13.6 receiving overall; 4-27-6.8 rushing) and working on special teams (14-56-4.0 punt returns; 2-39-19.5 kick returns).",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/freddie-swain/32005357-4108-6661-a1b9-6c0262d1d23d
Teair Tart,"Teiar (pronounced tee-air) Tart's first high school did not have a football team. He was seen playing basketball by a West Philadelphia High football coach and transferred to the school. Tart wound up at ASA College in New York, recording five sacks in six games before quitting the team after the death of a family member. He bounced around a bit before finally suiting up at Ellsworth Community College (Iowa) in 2017. Just two games into that season, however, Tart tore his left meniscus. FIU gave him a shot in 2018 and he showed his promise. Tart led the Panthers with four sacks (19 total tackles, seven for loss) in 12 games (two starts).

Kenny Willekes,"An All-Michigan pick as both a linebacker and running back after his senior year of high school, Willekes (pronounced WILL-uh-KISS) still had to walk on at MSU. He immediately showed his worth on the scout team in 2015, earning the squad's player of the week award six times -- more than anyone else. Willekes only played in one game, though, in 2016 due to the Spartans' depth but exploded on the scene as a sophomore. He led the team with 14.5 tackles for loss and seven sacks in 2017 (73 total tackles), grabbing third-team All-Big Ten honors. League coaches named him their Defensive Lineman of the Year in 2018 after he finished in the top 10 nationally with 20.5 tackles for loss and led MSU with 8.5 sacks among his 78 stops. He suffered a broken left fibula in the team's bowl game, however, which kept him from jumping to the NFL. Willekes showed the toughness to return for all 13 games in 2019, garnering second-team all-conference notice after leading the Spartans with 16 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks among his 78 total stops (he also caused and recovered two fumbles).",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-willekes/32005749-4c11-7123-5026-0468d1042a12

Dustin Woodard,"Undersized, but unmistakably tough and determined. Woodard's four seasons as a starting lineman have coincided with impressive rushing seasons by a variety of runners who are now in the pros. He moves with explosive burst off the snap and is made for a zone scheme, but is not a finesse center. While he looks to mix it up, he lacks the length and bend to foster block-sustain when moving forward. He should be decent in pass pro, but a lack of patience and that same inconsistent pad level creates opportunities for rush counters to beat him.",5.8,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dustin-woodard/3200574f-4f20-1766-512c-2ffdbcceb7b6

He did excel on special teams as a freshman, however, racking up eight coverage tackles in 10 games. Jones played in 12 games as a reserve in 2017 (four tackles). He managed to bounce back from knee surgery in June 2018 to make 12 tackles, one for loss, in 12 games that fall. The brother of former Notre Dame defensive lineman Jarron Jones found a starting job in 2019 thanks, in part, to injuries.

Bravvion Roy,"Bravvion (pronounced BRAY-vee-on) Roy was a Baylor fan in high school and enjoyed watching the dominant play of DT Andrew Billings. Now young Texans are looking up to Roy, who steadily improved throughout his career to justify the top-200 national recruit ranking he earned coming out of Spring High School (15 tackles for loss, six sacks as a senior). He played in nine games, with one start, as a true freshman in 2016 before dislocating his elbow. As a sophomore, Roy played in 12 games with four starts (31 tackles, three for loss, 0.5 sack). Coaches started him in 11 of the 13 games he played his junior campaign (34 tackles, three for loss, 1.5 sacks). Roy took his game to another level as a senior, racking up 61 stops, 13 for loss, and 5.5 sacks in 14 games (13 starts) to earn first-team All-Big 12 accolades.

Grayland Arnold,"Kountze, Texas, is a small city, but Arnold's talent didn't go unnoticed, as the do-everything star earned Class 3A All-State honors as a defensive back while also playing quarterback, wideout and kick/punt returner. He proved the move to the Big 12 was not too big for him as a true freshman, starting four of 11 games played at cornerback (20 tackles, two for loss, four pass breakups). Arnold started nine contests as a sophomore (35 tackles, three for loss, one interception, seven pass breakups) after missing the first three games with a broken arm. An ankle injury caused him to miss nine games and take a medical redshirt in 2018; he posted six tackles in four games with two starts on the season. Arnold was voted a single-digit jersey (No. 1) by his teammates for the second straight year in 2019, and he remained healthy enough to start 11 of 13 games played as a safety/nickel back. He was a second-team All-Big 12 honoree thanks to finishing tied for fifth in the FBS with six interceptions while also posting 46 stops, 2.5 for loss, and two breakups.

The third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Mountain West Conference selection started all 13 games and posted 55 tackles, five for loss. He was a productive defensive back and all-purpose offensive threat at Castle Park High School in San Diego before he tore his hamstring his senior year. He started as a freshman at Grossmont College but stopped attending school after the season. Given a second chance by Grossmont coaches, he played both offensive and defense in 2017.

He bounced back strong as a senior, though, garnering honorable mention All-ACC accolades by collecting 50 tackles, including nine for loss (three sacks) in 13 starts. Crawford rated highly coming out of Stone Bridge High School in Virginia as a first-team 5A all-state pick. He played in two games as a true freshman (six tackles) but redshirted after suffering a season-ending knee injury.

His 2016 season was lost to a foot injury and and his 2017 campaign was cut short after two games due to a rib injury suffered against his home-state Missouri Tigers. Markway returned to play in all 13 games in 2018 (three receptions, 53 yards, 17.7 average, one touchdown, one start) before finally getting his chance to be a regular contributor in the passing game the following fall.

Benny LeMay,"Benny's brother, Uriah, was a receiver at Georgia before transferring to Charlotte, where he played from 2014-2017. The younger brother signed on in 2016 after a solid career at Butler High School in Matthews, North Carolina. As a true freshman, LeMay played in nine games for the 49ers, starting once (34-175-5.1 rushing; 5-28-5.6 receiving). He earned more carries in 2017, starting eight of 11 games played (137-732-5.3, two TDs rushing; 9-88-9.8, two TDs receiving). LeMay was a team captain as a junior, leading the team in rushing (232-1,243-5.4, 11 TDs; 21-282-13.4 receiving) and garnering second-team All-Conference USA honors. He was a first-team all-conference pick his senior year as the 49ers' leading rusher (193-1,082-5.6,  nine TDs rushing; 19-242-12.7, four TDs receiving in 11 starts).",5.62,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/benny-lemay/32004c45-4d12-5404-b9bb-954b2efef156
Vernon Scott,"Traits-based prospect with good height, weight, speed and length but lacking consistency on tape to pair with those traits. Scott isn't an enforcer by any means, but he does have the frame and toughness to get ball-carriers down when needed. His experience covering the slot adds to his value, but he does have man-cover limitations and he's not equipped to play single-high safety. He's average at several things but doesn't carry many pluses from a performance standpoint. He will need to step up his game to nail down a role.",5.62,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/vernon-scott/32005343-4f71-9678-98c1-797d431d01f3
Geno Stone,"Stone was underappreciated as a high school recruit, as he never received a scholarship offer from his home-state Penn State Nittany Lions and had a visit canceled by Michigan State. Iowa grabbed him from his initial commitment to Kent State in the end, using him as a reserve in 11 games his true freshman season (17 tackles, one interception). Though Stone started just eight of 13 games as a sophomore, he made a number of plays. He racked up 39 tackles, broke up three passes, forced a fumble, and picked off four passes -- returning one of those for a 24-yard touchdown against Penn State. Stone was a team leader in 2019, garnering second-team All-Big Ten notice with 70 tackles, three for loss, one sack, one interception, four pass breakups and three forced fumbles in 13 starts.",5.62,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/geno-stone/32005354-4f39-6630-4d73-2328fd2eb451
Tyrie Cleveland,"Cleveland was a star receiver at Houston's Westfield High School before heading to Gainesville. He started four games as a true freshman, grabbing 14 passes for 298 yards (21.3 per) and two touchdowns in 11 games. Cleveland led the Gators with 410 receiving yards on 22 receptions (scoring twice) in 10 games with eight starts as a sophomore. He started 12 games in 2018 (18-212-11.8, three TDs), but missed the Peach Bowl due to an injured shoulder. The team's depth at receiver made Cleveland a reserve for all but two of 13 games played in 2019 (25-351-14.0, one TD), though he also contributed on special teams (5-124-24.8 kickoff returns, three tackles).",5.61,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyrie-cleveland/3200434c-4570-1617-f5ae-6da3bdb088ac
Sean McKeon,"McKeon (pronounced muh-Q-in) was a two-time all-state selection at Shepherd Hill Regional High School in Massachusetts (where he played with 2019 first-round pick Chris Lindstrom). He was rated as one of the top 25 tight end recruits in the country. After playing in just four games as a reserve his true freshman season (two catches, 10 yards), McKeon garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten notice the following year after leading the team with 31 receptions (for 301 yards, 9.7 per) and three touchdowns. While his production dropped as a junior (14 receptions, 122 yards, 8.7 average, one touchdown), McKeon was again voted honorable mention all-conference. A third honorable mention nod came his way in 2019 after he played in 10 games (seven starts) and made 13 catches for 235 yards (18.1 per) and two scores.",5.61,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-mckeon/32004d43-4b34-7771-1f47-b2b98c9a4c48
Caleb Repp,"Repp transferred from Utah to Utah State to play in coach Gary Andersen's offense. The move paid off, as he caught 36 passes for 455 yards (12.6 average) and four scores on his way to honorable mention All-Mountain West Conference honors.  The three-star recruit was a three-sport star (football, basketball, track) at Los Osos High School in California before joining the Utes. Repp played in 11 games as a freshman in 2015, starting six times as a receiver/tight end hybrid, catching two passes for 25 yards and two scores against Oregon for his only statistics on the year. He redshirted in 2016 to switch to defense for the next season (seven tackles, one sack, two forced fumbles in 13 games as a reserve defensive end). Repp played in 12 games as a junior, making 14 tackles (one sack) on defense and playing tight end (no receptions) in two contests.",5.61,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/caleb-repp/32005245-5053-9877-c0c5-18bb22fa59a4
DeMarkus Acy,"Acy was a three-star recruit out of Dallas after making 146 tackles as a senior safety. Missouri coaches put him in at cornerback as a true freshman. He started once in the 11 games he played (six tackles, two pass breakups). He started 12 of 13 games played as a sophomore (48 tackles, five for loss, three pass breakups) before becoming a second-team All-SEC performer in 2018. Acy led the Tigers with three interceptions that year, broke up 10 passes, and posted 30 tackles. He also had an unfortunate pass interference penalty against Kentucky that season, wrestling with a receiver in the end zone on the final play of regulation. The subsequent untimed down ended in a touchdown, and win, for the Wildcats. Acy's production declined drastically in his senior season, as he only made 15 tackles and broke up five passes in 10 starts (he missed time with a hamstring injury).",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demarkus-acy/32004143-5941-5291-52f1-5257c81c2abf
Trajan Bandy,"Despite Bandy's obvious talent (four-star recruit, top-35 corner prospect nationally), Bandy's father said then-Hurricanes head coach Al Golden told Bandy he would have to grow another inch before recruiting him. When Mark Richt took over the reins, that situation was remedied. Bandy started three of 13 games as a true freshman (25 tackles, 1.5 for loss, one interception returned for a touchdown, six pass breakups). He became an even bigger playmaker in his sophomore campaign, receiving third-team All-ACC notice as a 13-game starter (36 tackles, 4.5 for loss, eight pass breakups). Bandy led the 'Canes in the number of times wearing the famed Turnover Chain, donning it five times (three interceptions, two fumble recoveries) in '18. He was a third-team all-conference selection as a junior, as well, posting 29 tackles, three sacks and eight pass breakups in 13 starts on the year. Bandy grew up just down the street from the grandmother of the late Miami and NFL safety Sean Taylor.",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trajan-bandy/32004241-4e24-6232-fe0b-013f8a395a53
Case Cookus,"Not highly recruited out of California's Thousand Oaks High School, Cookus attended Ventura Junior College for a year but did not play football. NAU gave him a shot and watched him win the 2015 Jerry Rice Award as the top freshman in the FCS. The third-team All-American and first-team All-Big Sky pick ranked second in the country with 37 passing touchdowns, third with a 69.0 completion percentage (223-323) and ninth with 3,117 passing yards. Cookus started four games in 2016 (80-119-67.2, 1,173 yards, 13 TDs, one INT) but missed the rest of the season with a collarbone injury. He started all 12 games the next season, throwing for 3,413 yards (275-474-58.0, 22 TDs, six INTs). Another collarbone injury cost him his fourth season with the Lumberjacks, limiting him to just two starts (23-34-70.6, 265 yards, two TDs, two INTs). One of those starts was an upset win over FBS foe UTEP. Cookus set multiple school records in 2019, also garnering the odd first-team Associated Press FCS All-American but second-team All-Big Sky honors. In 12 starts, he completed 60.3 percent of his throws (290-481) for 4,114 yards and 31 touchdowns against seven interceptions.",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/case-cookus/3200434f-4f35-4912-142a-53bbdea75b07
Tyler Davis,"Tight end with adequate height, weight and speed, but lacking the route savvy of a pass-catching option or the toughness of an in-line blocker. Davis is a quarterback turned receiver turned tight end who plays a more finesse-oriented brand of football. He will struggle to uncover in and out of breaks and needs to stay on the move in the passing game. He's a positional blocker who has trouble sustaining at an NFL level.",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-davis/32004441-5678-1752-b68c-f5e2580700d9
Cale Garrett,"A Missouri native, Garrett wanted badly to play for the Tigers. The state Class 4A Defensive Player of the Year planned on attending the Naval Academy until Mizzou made its late scholarship offer. The home-state hero led the team in tackles as a sophomore (105, 10 for loss, three sacks, two interceptions) and junior (112, 6.5 for loss, one sack). He was a team captain and second-team All-SEC pick during his junior year. Even as a freshman, Garrett got two starts and posted 47 tackles, six for loss, an interception and two pass breakups in 12 games. His senior campaign was limited to five starts, however, as he tore a pectoral tendon. Garrett still led the team with three interceptions in spite of his limited time on the field, also posting 43 tackles, five for loss, two sacks and two pass breakups.",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cale-garrett/32004741-5239-9610-1a08-445f3a265c0e
Stephen Guidry,"MSU landed Guidry as the top junior college receiver recruit in the country prior to the 2018 season. He actually enrolled in January 2018 but was nursing a shoulder injury. Despite starting just five of 13 games played in '18, he led the Bulldogs with 440 receiving yards on 19 receptions (with three scores), averaging a whopping 23.2 yards per catch. He started nine of 13 games played as a senior (30-387-12.9, five TDs). Guidry, an All-Louisiana receiver and three-sport athlete (basketball, football, track) in high school, excelled in both seasons at Hinds Community College in Mississippi (30-547-18.2, five TDs as a freshman, 22-326-14.8, four TDs as a sophomore).",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stephen-guidry/32004755-4924-0683-c9b7-5321e6e039e2
Jaylinn Hawkins,"Jaylinn Hawkins was a teammate of his younger uncle at Cal. Jaylinn's father is the much older brother of Jeremiah Hawkins, a receiver at Cal. Scouts, of course, are far more interested in Jaylinn's play than his family tree, as he tied for third in the FBS with six interceptions in 2018. He picked off three passes in the Cheez-It Bowl that year, earning Defensive MVP honors to cap off an excellent season (32 tackles, 3.5 for loss, three pass breakups, 12 starts in 13 games). Hawkins was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick in 2019 after again leading Cal with three interceptions. He also compiled 56 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks, two pass breakups and two forced fumbles in 13 starts. Hawkins started 11 games in 2017, recording 41 stops, 1.5 for loss, and an interception.

Brian Herrien,"A Georgia native, Herrien worked hard late in his high school career to qualify academically so he could play for the Bulldogs. He was rated among the 20 best running backs in his recruiting class but found himself buried in a stacked depth chart behind the likes of Nick Chubb, Elijah Holyfield, Sony Michel and D'Andre Swift. Herrien did not start any of the 40 games in which he played his first three years on campus. He did contribute each season, however: 63 carries, 363 yards, 5.8 ypc, three touchdowns in 2016; 51 carries, 265 yards, 4.3 ypc, one touchdown in 2017; 50 carries, 295 yards, 5.9 ypc, three touchdowns in 2018. Herrien had career highs in carries (103), yards (490, 4.8 per) and touchdowns (6) in 12 games (two starts) as a senior. He also contributed as a receiver (16 receptions, 110 yards, 6.9 average, one touchdown) and on special teams (six returns, 149 yards, 24.8 average).

Sterling Hofrichter,"Punter with below average size but a quality leg used for both punting and field goal duties. Hofrichter's hangtime was one of the best in college football and he proved that he could hit the open-field punt with consistent distance while putting english on pooch punts near the end zone. He's feisty as a tackler, but may need to back off a bit to stay healthy.

He led his team with 114 stops in 13 starts his sophomore campaign (seven for loss, three sacks, two forced fumbles). A shoulder injury forced Mack to the sideline for four games in 2018 (66 tackles, six for loss, 2.5 sacks in nine starts) but he bounced back with a strong senior season. He led Virginia with 7.5 sacks and posted 69 total stops, 8.5 for loss, and two forced fumbles in 13 contests (12 starts). Mack was a finalist for the William V.

Josh Pearson,"The talent that Pearson showed his junior year was not evident through his first three seasons with the Gamecocks. He redshirted in 2015 and has said his grades started to slip over the next two seasons, costing him eligibility and part of his scholarship. He told The Gasden Times that  ""chasing women"" was his problem during that time. It appears maturity set in before his junior season, and he wound up a Walter Payton Award finalist and first-team Associated Press All-American as a 13-game starter. Pearson caught 67 passes for 1,123 yards (16.8 per) and tied for the FCS lead with 17 touchdown catches. He won an Ohio Valley Conference Sportsmanship Award in May 2019, and then second-team all-conference notice in the fall (59 receptions, 943 yards, 16.0 average, 13 touchdowns in 12 starts).",5.6,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-pearson/32005045-4149-3149-bc8b-ab5ed55c816f
Artavis Pierce,"Pierce was coming into his own as a junior, earning the starting nod for the first three games of the year before an elbow injury sidelined him for three weeks.

The two-time all-county pick from Lake Alfred, Florida, trekked across the country to matriculate in Corvallis, becoming the first in his family to attend college. Pierce got plenty of playing time as a reserve his true freshman campaign (98 carries, 523 yards, 5.3 average, four touchdowns; 21 receptions, 132 yards, 6.3 average, one touchdown) and earned a couple of starts as a sophomore (68 carries, 323 yards, 4.8 average, one touchdown; 15 receptions, 128 yards, 8.5 average; 27 kickoff returns, 540 yards, 20.0 average). In 2019, Pierce started eight of 12 games played, leading the Beavers with 873 rushing yards and scoring six times on 146 carries (6.0 per). He also caught 23 throws for 169 yards (7.3 per).

He started three (two at linebacker, one at end) of 12 games played as a sophomore (37 tackles, four for loss, two sacks). Roach's junior campaign was interrupted by a fractured foot -- he started three games at linebacker (24 tackles, 1.5 for loss). He lined up at defensive end for the team's bowl game, just as he did in 13 starts as a senior. Roach was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick in 2019 (40 tackles, nine for loss, three sacks, one blocked kick). Mike Roach, Malcolm's father, was an All-American linebacker at Southern University.

Lachavious Simmons,"Tackle/guard prospect with plus physical traits but lacking in power, instincts and technique. Simmons has starting experience at both guard and tackle, but his body type and style of play feel much more like a tackle. His long arms can be effective in his pass protection and he's an adequate athlete who shouldn't have severe scheme limitations as a run blocker.

He repeated his first-team all-conference performance as a senior, again topping his squad with 99 tackles (10.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks), intercepting two passes, breaking up three others and forcing two fumbles in 13 starts. The Los Angeles native was a four-star recruit, which made it unsurprising that he was named the team's Defensive Scout Player of the Year in his redshirt year. He played in 11 games as a reserve in 2016 (five tackles, 1.5 sacks).

Thomas started twice in 11 games as a sophomore (35-563-16.1, three TDs receiving; 10-260-26.0 kick returns; 9-221-24.6, one TD punt returns) but head coach Mark Richt announced in November 2018 that Thomas was no longer a member of the team (Thomas later said it was a ""mutual decision"" for him to leave the program before the end of the year). Thomas planned on transferring to Illinois, but the arrival of new Miami coach Manny Diaz meant a second chance. He started seven of 10 games played in his final collegiate season, recording 31 receptions for 379 yards (12.2 per) and three scores (also 12-268-22.3 kick returns; 5-44-8.8 punt returns).

Turk decided to transfer to ASU after that season, meaning he would have to sit out the fall of 2018, per NCAA regulations. He excelled in his one and only season with the Sun Devils, leading the Pac-12 in punting average (59-2,476-46.0) to receive first-team all-conference recognition.

His father (Bob) was a defensive lineman for the Gophers, his grandfather (Tom) was MVP of the 1959 Minnesota squad, a strong player for the 1960 baseball national titlists, and the school's athletic director. The four-star recruit and top-five linebacker prospect nationally helped his Eden Prairie High team win 40 straight games before matriculating. He played in 11 games with one start in 2016 (25 tackles, four for loss, two sacks) before earning honorable mention All-Big Ten notice as a sophomore (37 tackles, led team with 11.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in 12 starts). Coughlin was named second-team all-conference and Minnesota's Most Outstanding Defensive Player in 2018 after again leading his squad with 15 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks (48 total stops) while also tying for ninth in the FBS with four forced fumbles. He was a second-team all-conference selection his senior year, as well, leading the Gophers with 9.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks while also compiling 49 total stops, four pass breakups, and two forced fumbles.",5.59,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carter-coughlin/3200434f-5505-7248-98b5-e1e661c55f10
Garrett Marino,"Marino was a first-team all-state defender at Mission Viejo High School in California and signed with Arizona State. He did not qualify academically, however, and ended up at Montana State the following fall. Marino played six games there (eight tackles, one for loss) before leaving the team midway through the year. Marino signed with UAB in August 2015, and he waited two seasons for the Blazers' football teams to return from hiatus after the team was dissolved by the school's administration after 2014. Once on the field again, Marino showed off his talent with two straight honorable mention All-Conference USA seasons. He had 33 tackles, eight for loss, one sack and three pass breakups in 13 games (six starts) in 2017. Marino then posted 19 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 13 games (nine starts) as a junior. He was a first-team all-conference pick in leading his team to a bowl game in 2019 (43 tackles, 13.5 for loss, six sacks, seven pass breakups, one blocked kick in 14 games with 13 starts). Marino will turn 26 years old before the 2020 NFL regular season begins.",5.59,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garrett-marino/32004d41-5214-9966-4c60-99f6f0d9c87e
Tyshun Render,"Render's senior season was underappreciated by Conference USA coaches, who failed to name him honorable mention all-league despite his 49 tackles, 10 for loss, 3.5 sacks, five pass breakups, one interception and two forced fumbles in 12 starts. This is nothing new, since he was underrecruited coming out of Westlake High School in Georgia, where he was an all-region defender as a senior (17 tackles for loss, nine sacks). After redshirting his first year in Murfreesboro, Render did receive C-USA All-Freshman Team notice from those coaches in 2016 after playing in all 13 games as a reserve (19 tackles, one for loss). He started 4 of 13 games played the following year (26 tackles, one for loss) before earning more playing time his junior campaign (25 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks in 13 games, with three starts).",5.59,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyshun-render/32005245-4e10-2198-1c33-00b086f9fb17
James Smith-Williams,"N.C. State head coach Dave Doeren chose Smith-Williams, a Raleigh native, to wear the team's No. 1 jersey in 2019 for this work ethic, character, leadership and accomplishments. While he did not make the coaches' all-conference team in 2018, Smith-Williams excelled on the field (37 tackles, 9.5 for loss, six sacks) as much as he did off it. The December 2018 graduate was as an intern at IBM, working on robotic animation; he scored a 30 on his ACT and had a weighted 4.9 grade-point average in high school. Smith-Williams struggled to stay on the field for the Wolfpack throughout his career, however, due to injuries and the team's depth up front. He redshirted after four games in 2015 due to injury (four tackles), and then played in eight contests as a reserve the following year (13 tackles) before suffering another season-ending malady. Smith-Williams stayed healthy for 12 games in 2017 as a reserve (10 tackles, 1.5 for loss) before taking the aforementioned big step as a junior. He started just seven games in 2019, though, due to a lower-body injury (20 tackles, one sack). Smith-Williams did garner a spot on the 2019 AFCA All-Good Works team.",5.59,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-smith-williams/3200534d-4984-1542-2bc0-161ee81572aa
Essang Bassey,"Wake landed a valuable defender when it signed Bassey out of Columbus, Georgia (though Bassey excelled on offense in high school as well, with over 1,000 rushing/receiving yards as a senior). He played in 13 games as a key reserve his true freshman season (19 tackles, 1.5 for loss, three pass breakups). Bassey ranked second in the ACC with 19 passes defensed (three interceptions, 16 pass breakups) as a sophomore, which led ACC coaches to vote him honorable mention all-conference (he also posted 75 tackles, six for loss, in 13 starts). They voted Bassey second-team all-league in 2018 as he recorded 74 stops, 2.5 for loss, an interception, and 15 pass breakups in 13 starts for the Demon Deacons.

Anthony Gordon,"Gordon battled Gardner Minshew for the Cougars' starting quarterback job before the 2018 season but came up short to the eventual NCAA leader in passing yards. He stuck with head coach Mike Leach, however, despite having to wait three years (redshirt in 2016, did not play in 2017) for the starting role he earned in 2019. Gordon was named second-team All-Pac-12 after leading the country with 689 pass attempts, 493 completions (ranking fourth in the FBS with a 71.6 completion percentage) and finishing second to Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow for the national lead in passing yards (5,579) and touchdowns (48, with 16 interceptions) in 13 starts. Gordon came to WSU after leading the City College of San Francisco to a state junior college championship in 2015 (286-of-439, 65.1 completion percentage, 3,864 yards, 37 touchdowns, 13 interceptions). He was the California Medium School State Player of the Year at Terra Nova High School as a senior.

Pete Guerrerio,"It's hard to believe now, but Guerriero went to Monmouth to run track. He was the conference 100- and 200-meter champion as a freshman in the spring of 2017 before trying his hand at football. It's not as though he didn't excel on the gridiron in high school; he was a second-team All-North Jersey pick at Lyndhurst High School his senior year, as well as a basketball and track athlete. Once on the Monmouth football team, Guerriero made an immediate impact, earning Big South Conference Co-Freshman of the Year (first team at running back and returner) and various All-American honors (178-1,061-6.0, nine TDs rushing; 20-119-6.0 receiving; 6-228-38.0, one TD kick returns in 11 games). He started six of nine games played in 2018, receiving second-team all-conference recognition (134-918-6.9, eight TDs rushing; 17-96-5.6 receiving; 4-71-17.8 kick returns). Despite starting his career with two productive seasons, Guerriero nearly eclipsed his rushing (298-1,995-6.7, 18 TDs) and receiving (32-336, two TDs) totals in 2019. He was a consensus first-team All-American, led the FCS in rushing and finished third in voting for the Walter Payton Award (given to the division's top offensive player).

Ty'Son Williams,"Williams transferred from South Carolina to BYU as a graduate student in 2019 but did not get to play in most of what turned out to be his final collegiate season. He played in four games, leading the Cougars in rushing (49-264-5.4, three TDs; also 7-47-6.7 receiving) before missing the rest of the year with a torn ACL. Williams' move to Provo was his second transfer, as he began his career at the University of North Carolina. He moved on after one year (19-57-3.0 rushing in six games), and then was required to walk onto the Gamecocks because of transfer restrictions. The Sumter native (who rushed for 30 touchdowns in his final two years at Crestwood High) returned to his home state, redshirting in 2016 and contributing in 12 games the following year (95-471-5.0, one TD rushing; 12-32-2.7, one TD receiving) with three starts.

Washington's junior season was his healthiest, catching 43 passes for 711 yards (15.8 per) and three scores in 13 starts. He completed the year with a nine-catch, 158-yard performance in the Belk Bowl. Washington was inserted as a Hail Mary defender late in a 2018 game against North Carolina State, intercepting Ryan Finley's last-second heave.",5.52,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/scotty-washington/32005741-5372-4960-d4f7-3f65bd7381a7
Eli Mencer,"Mencer moved from linebacker to stand-up defensive end before his senior season. The move paid major benefits for him and the Great Danes, who made the FCS playoffs thanks to the school-record 14.5 sacks Mencer accumulated. The Altoona, Pennsylvania, native garnered second-team FCS All-American honors from the Associated Press and first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association honors for his exploits. Mencer started 10 of 11 games as a junior, posting 58 tackles, 8.5 for loss, and 4.5 sacks on the year. Even as a sophomore he showed promise, forcing five fumbles to rank third in the FCS and earning third-team All-CAA notice (60 tackles, eight for loss, two pass breakups). As a redshirt freshman, Mencer played in nine games at linebacker (nine tackles, 1.5 sacks) while also returning two kickoffs for 48 yards (24.0 per).",5.51,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eli-mencer/32004d45-4e10-6494-163a-e6ff5380c582
Sewo Olonilua,"Sewo Olonilua (pronounced SHAY-woe oh-lon-UH-loo-uh) was the star of one of the most bizarre bowl games in recent memory. TCU beat Cal, 10-7, in overtime at the 2018 Cheez-It Bowl, as the team combined to throw nine interceptions. Olonilua won Offensive MVP honors by covering 194 yards on 32 carries and scoring TCU's only touchdown. He led the Horned Frogs with 635 yards rushing on the year (135 carries, 4.7 average, two TDs) while also catching 15 passes for 86 yards (5.7 average). He was suspended for the first half of the 2019 season opener as a penalty for a felony drug possession arrest last May. In 12 games in 2019, Olonulia rushed for a team-high eight scores (134-537-4.0) and contributed as a receiver (24-114-4.8, one TD) and kick returner (5-96-19.2).

He played in all 14 games as a reserve his sophomore season, contributing as a runner (64-330-5.2, seven TDs, receiver (19-166-8.7), and kick returner (3-50-16.7).

Charlie Woerner,"Woerner (pronounced WER-ner) is the nephew of College Football Hall of Fame defensive back Scott Woerner, who helped the Bulldogs win a national title in 1980 with punt and interception returns for touchdowns against Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Charlie did not have many big moments in his first three years between the hedges, scoring no touchdowns even though he played in 40 games. He got that elusive touchdown in 2019, catching nine passes for 78 yards in 14 starts. A top-10 tight end recruit nationally, he started twice as a true freshman (5-50-10.0), once as a sophomore (9-100-11.1), and twice as a junior (11-148-13.5).",5.51,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charlie-woerner/3200574f-4513-8430-be36-5db8fe66161b

He came into his own as a junior with veteran Myles Gaskin moving onto the NFL, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors as a 12-game starter, rushing 188 times for 1,020 yards (5.4 per) and scoring 11 times (16-84-5.3 receiving; 5-116-23.2 kick returns). Ahmed did get carries even while Gaskin was around, starting three of 14 games as a sophomore (104-608-5.8, seven TDs rushing; 21-170-8.1 receiving). He was the team's Co-Freshman of the Year in 2017, also garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors for his work on offense (61-388-6.4, three TDs rushing; 13-77-5.9 receiving) and special teams (14-353-25.2 kick returns).

Henry Black,"Black played a safety/linebacker hybrid role for Baylor in 2019, recording 62 tackles, one for loss, one interception, and four pass breakups in 14 starts. He started at both linebacker (three games) and safety (one game) as a junior, playing in 13 games overall (24 tackles, three for loss, two sacks). His teammates voted him the honor of wearing a single-digit jersey before the 2018 season, a tradition then-head coach Matt Rhule brought to town. As a sophomore safety, Black started six of 12 games (25 tackles, one interception). The two-time All-Louisiana selection from Woodlawn High School in Shreveport contributed for the Bears as a redshirt freshman in 2016 (eight tackles in 13 games).",5.5,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henry-black/3200424c-4106-5504-33e0-03bac43274b8
Branden Bowen,"Bowen patiently waited his turn to contribute to the Buckeyes' offensive line on a full-time basis. The patience paid off with 2019 second-team All-Big Ten accolades in 12 starts at right tackle. He played as a reserve in five games as a freshman and eight games his sophomore year. He earned the starting right guard job for the first six games of the 2017 campaign before a horrific leg injury ended his season and resulted in two surgeries, one to insert rods, plates, and screws. Bowen had another surgery in the summer of 2018 because the fibula did not heal correctly. He redshirted the 2018 season due to this setback. He could have played by the end of the year but the team's depth on the line did not require it. Bowen was one of the top prospects coming out of Utah in 2015, and is the father of Booker, who was born in March 2019.",5.5,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/branden-bowen/3200424f-5709-8395-c75f-36a1737da50d

He earned the starting job as a sophomore, recording 65 tackles, eight for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 12 games. Coatney's production dropped his junior year (51 tackles, three for loss) though he started 10 of 11 games played.

However, Divinity only played in six games as a senior (three starts, 23 tackles, four for loss, three sacks), as he missed nine contests as he dealt with an ankle injury and ineligibility due to violations of team rules. He was reinstated for the national title game. The former second-team High School All-American and Class 5A Defensive MVP from nearby Marrero (he played quarterback at John Curtis before moving to John Ehret as a senior) saw the field in nine games his true freshman season (13 tackles).

Shea Patterson,"Patterson's father, Sean, was a Michigan fan from Toledo, Ohio, who often told bedtime stories that Shea would eventually lead UM to comeback wins. Shea's collegiate career, however, started in Oxford, Mississippi. The top quarterback prospect in the country signed with Ole Miss out of IMG Academy in Florida, where he played one year after starring in football, basketball, and baseball at Louisiana's Calvary Baptist High School. Patterson had to step in for injured Rebels starter Chad Kelly as a true freshman, starting the final three games of the year (72 of 132, 54.5 completion percentage, 880 yards, six touchdowns, three interceptions; 41 carries, 169 yards, 4.1 ypc). He had his own knee injury that cut his 2017 season short after seven games (166 of 260, 63.8 completion percentage, 2,259 yards, 17 touchdowns, nine interceptions). Patterson transferred from Ole Miss to Michigan after the 2017 season and fought the NCAA for immediate eligibility because he thought Ole Miss coaches misled him about the severity of the NCAA sanctions coming down on the program.

He also had five rushing touchdowns on the year. Patterson wore jersey No. 20 at Ole Miss to honor his grandfather, George, who wore that number for the Detroit Pistons in the 1960s.

Bryce Perkins,"Bryce is the son of former Arizona State and Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Bruce Perkins, the brother of former UCLA and New York Giants running back Paul Perkins and the nephew of former Dallas Cowboys star back Don Perkins. With that football family tree, it's no surprise he was the Arizona Division I Player of the Year as a senior at Chandler High School. He began his collegiate career at his dad's alma mater but suffered two broken vertebrae during practice his redshirt freshman season. He chose not to have the surgery that would have ended his football career and had already made up his mind to transfer after ASU coaches wanted him to change positions. Perkins went to Arizona Western Community College in 2017 to prove himself as a passer, and all he did was lead them to the national junior college title game. Virginia gave Perkins a shot to replace departed starter Kurt Benkert in 2018. He stepped up again, garnering honorable mention All-ACC honors by setting a school record for total offense and joining Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray as the only two FBS quarterbacks with 2,600 passing yards and 900 rushing yards (225-349-64.5, 2,680 yards, 25 TDs, nine INTs passing; 212-923-4.4, nine TDs rushing).

Drew Richmond,"Richmond was a top-10 offensive tackle recruit nationally when he made a last-minute commitment switch from Ole Miss to his home-state Tennessee. He started six of nine games at left tackle with the Volunteers as a redshirt freshman and had a tumultuous sophomore season, serving a suspension for ""a violation of team rules"" in the season opener before going on to start seven games on the blindside (missed four games after suffering an injury). Richmond was moved to right tackle in 2018, starting all 12 games before deciding to transfer to USC as a graduate student in 2019. USC used Richmond at that same spot and he started 12 contests.",5.5,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/drew-richmond/32005249-4369-7093-560a-623855a48834
Mathew Sexton,"Sexton was chosen to wear the revered No. 2 jersey for his senior season with the Eagles, in respect to the late former EMU receiver Demarius Reed, who was shot dead in 2013. Sexton started 11 games in 2019 (34-508-14.9, four TDs receiving; 5-14-2.8 rushing; returned only punt for 50-yard TD), breaking his collarbone in the penultimate regular-season game. Sexton played in eight games as a true freshman (3-51-17.0 receiving), started 2 of 12 games played in 2017 (26-357-13.7, two TDs receiving; 18-312-17.3 kickoff returns; 14 tackles on special teams) and then started all 12 games his junior campaign (37-419-11.3, three TDs receiving; seven special teams tackles). EMU beat Big Ten teams in three of Sexton's four seasons with the team (Rutgers-2017; Purdue-2018; Illinois-2019). Despite being a star runner, receiver and defender at Clinton High in Michigan (99 TDs, 6,623 total yards of offense, 340 tackles in his career), as well as part of a state title-winning 400-meter relay team, Sexton's lack of size kept him from getting Power Five scholarship offers.",5.5,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mathew-sexton/32005345-5843-2166-fbdb-bd913240c154
Reid Sinnett,"Talk about taking advantage of an opportunity -- Sinnett did not start a game his first three seasons with the Toreros but grabbed the bull by the horn as a senior, earning first-team All-Pioneer Football League honors and a finalist spot for the Walter Payton FCS Offensive Player of the Year Award. He completed 251-of-375 passes (66.9 percent) for 3,528 yards and 32 touchdowns against just 10 interceptions in 12 games (also scoring six rushing touchdowns). He ranked fourth in the FCS in passing efficiency and ninth in passing yards per game (294.0). Sinnett's opportunities from 2016 to 2018 were very limited (24 of 48, 50.0 completion percentage, 316 yards, one touchdown, three interceptions in 33 contests).

Will Sunderland,"Sunderland was in line to become a starter at Oklahoma in 2017 before being charged with burglary for allegedly stealing and then selling video game systems that belonged to other students. The Sooners suspended him indefinitely as a result of this incident. Sunderland reached a plea deal for a misdemeanor and received a one-year deferred sentence (he would serve no time if he complied with a court-mandated probationary period). After spending a year at Rose State Community College (did not play football) in his hometown of Midwest City, Oklahoma, he signed on with Troy. In his first year with the Trojans, he played in all 13 games with four starts at nickel (21 tackles, three for loss). Sunderland played well as a senior, garnering first-team All-Sun Belt notice at cornerback with 38 tackles, two for loss, a team-high four interceptions, and four pass breakups. In his two seasons in Norman, the former top-125 high school recruit nationally played in eight games as a reserve safety in both his true freshman (three tackles) and sophomore (15 tackles, one for loss) seasons.

Tommy initially decided to take his own route, signing with Tennessee. After a redshirt season, though, he decided to transfer back to his home state to back up this brother. Tommy sat out for two years until Johnny went off to the NFL after being drafted by the Oakland Raiders. He took full advantage of his opportunity in 2018, ranking ninth in the FBS with 45.4 yards per punt (gross average) and forcing 22 fair catches on 51 punts.

Ben Victor,"While Victor did not start any games in his first three years with the Buckeyes, he was consistently a factor in the team's offense. The Florida native, who was rated as one of the top 15 receiver prospects in the country before arriving in Columbus, managed to get onto the field for five games as a true freshman in 2016 despite the team's depth at the position (4-64-16.0, one TD). Victor played in all 14 games as a sophomore, scoring seven times on his 23 receptions that covered 349 yards (15.2 per). He played in every game again in 2018, regularly making big plays (21-354-16.9, four TDs), including a 47-yard catch-and-run touchdown against Penn State that helped his team to a comeback win.

He excelled again as a versatile defender in 2019, garnering second-team All-Mountain West Conference honors. The team captain recorded 79 tackles, 8.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, three interceptions, 11 pass breakups and two forced fumbles on the year. White began his collegiate career as a reserve for eight games (six tackles) his redshirt freshman season.

Mitchell Wilcox,"NFL scouts loved what they saw from Wilcox during his time at USF, especially in 2018 when the first-team All-American Athletic Conference selection set school records for receptions (43) and receiving yards (540, 12.6 per) by a tight end while scoring twice. While his production dropped a little as the Bulls' offense struggled in 2019 (28 receptions, 350 yards, 12.5 per, five touchdowns in 12 starts), Wilcox was still an honorable mention all-conference selection. He may have fallen under the recruiting radar a bit in high school as he changed from offensive tackle to tight end his senior year, earning honorable mention all-state notice at Tarpon Springs High School in Florida. He redshirted in 2015 and then broke out with a second-team all-conference freshman year (12 receptions, 278 yards, 23.2 average, two touchdowns, started eight of 13 games played).

Williamson redshirted while making the move to the Big Ten in 2017, and then became a strong contributor off the bench in 11 contests as a junior (34 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one sack, one interception, four pass breakups).

Flora High School, earning the No. 2 rating nationally at the position (as well as top 15 as a kicker). He redshirted in 2015 and did not play in 2016 as Sean Kelly completed his career. Charlton stepped in admirably as a sophomore, earning the team's Special Teams MVP award in 2017 (43.5 gross average, 13 fair catches in 55 punts, 15 inside the 20 against four touchbacks). He repeated that honor, as well as garnering second-team All-SEC notice, as a junior (44.8 gross average, 26 fair catches in just 48 punts, 16 inside the 20 and only two touchbacks).

His career started off with a bump in the road, however, as he redshirted his first year on campus after being suspended for a DWI arrest. O'Grady contributed in eight games in 2016 (3-63-21.0, one TD) but became a more regular part of the offense as a sophomore (21-132-6.3, two TDs, one start in 11 games).

Guidry kept working on the track after arriving in Salt Lake City, finishing sixth in the 60-meter dash in the winter 2019 U.S. Indoor Championships. NFL scouts, however, were likely even more impressed by his play as a junior for the Utes, when he earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors for the second straight year, posting 42 tackles and six pass breakups in 14 games (12 starts). Guidry played in all 14 games as a sophomore, starting nine times and posting 42 stops, 3.5 for loss, one interception and nine pass breakups.

Longhorns coaches decided to put him in as a starter in nine games in his first year in Austin, when he was named Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Big 12. Shackelford struggled with an ankle injury during his sophomore year, though he played in 10 games with eight starts. League coaches felt he looked healthy enough in 2018 to deserve second-team all-conference notice as a 10-game starter in the pivot. Shackelford was a first-team All-Big 12 pick in 2019 as he started all 13 games in the middle.",5.44,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-shackelford/32005348-4102-3958-f6c5-357a3d9ece2d
Jonathan Ward,"Ward had an up-and-down career with the Chippewas but finished with a flourish in 2019. He was a third-team All-MAC pick and team captain, starting 12 games and leading his team with 1,108 rushing yards and 15 scores on 183 carries (6.1 average). Ward was also a big part of the passing game, catching 34 passes for 329 yards (9.7) and a touchdown. The Illinois native and all-state pick in football (2,400 yards, 36 TDs) and track (second in state long jump) struggled with injuries as a junior, starting 6 of 9 games (76-212-2.8, one TD rushing; 8-41-5.1 receiving). Expectations were high for Ward heading into that season because he was a second-team all-conference pick as a sophomore (team-high 178-1,019-5.7, 10 TDs rushing; 48-470-9.8, three TDs receiving, nine starts in 13 games). As a true freshman, he contributed in eight games as a reserve (36-200-5.6, two TDs rushing; 8-69-8.6 receiving; 6-138-23.0 kickoff returns).",5.44,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-ward/32005741-5223-1319-7a39-25c10d8660c9
Kendall Coleman,"Coleman was a two-time first-team all-state pick at Cathedral High School in Indianapolis when he signed on with the Orange before the 2016 season. He had been rehabbing a torn labrum (shoulder) he suffered during his senior season at Cathedral, but was given a chance to make plays as a true freshman, getting starts in 11 of 12 games (29 tackles, 1.5 for loss, one sack, one blocked kick). Coleman started eight games in 2017 (28 tackles, 2.5 for loss), missing four with a foot injury and then tearing his labrum against Louisville. He considered quitting football at that point but instead came back in 2018 to team with Alton Robinson as one of the top end duos in the country. He started 12 games as a junior, tying for second in the ACC with 10 sacks (32 total tackles, 12 for loss).

Jashon Cornell,"The Buckeyes grabbed Cornell from famed Cretin-Derham Hall High School in the Twin Cities, from where baseball star Joe Mauer, Heisman Trophy winner Chris Weinke and former NFL receiver Michael Floyd all graduated. The top-50 overall recruit nationally struggled to find the field early in his career due to the Buckeyes' talent up front. He redshirted in 2015 and played in five games as a reserve the following season (four tackles, 1.5 for loss). Cornell broke through a bit at defensive tackle in 2017, posting 14 stops (3.5 for loss, two sacks) as a reserve in 14 games. He got his first start as a junior in 2018, lining up against his home-state Gophers (15 tackles, two for loss, one sack in 13 games overall).

Parnell Motley,"Motley has been a significant part of the Sooners' secondary since his sophomore season. He started 13 of 14 games played that year, leading the squad with nine pass breakups and tying for the team lead with two interceptions (along with 63 tackles, 4.5 for loss). Big 12 coaches named him honorable mention all-conference in 2018 as he started eight of 14 games and intercepted a team-high three passes while knocking down 11 others. Motley was a second-team All-Big 12 selection in 2019, as he led the Sooners with 13 pass breakups and tied for second in the country with five forced fumbles. In 14 games (13 starts), he also posted 41 tackles, 1.5 for loss, and an interception. As a true freshman, Motley played in 11 games and made nine tackles as a backup.

Nelson and a few other teammates decided to transfer after that season, and he signed on with SMU after earning his degree. In 2018, he started 9 of 10 games played, tied for the team lead with two interceptions and also recorded 65 tackles, six for loss, 1.5 sacks and one pass breakup.

As a redshirt freshman, he played in all 14 games as a reserve and on special teams. SDSU coaches inserted him into the starting lineup at left guard for all 13 games the following season. Dixon started 12 games at that spot in again in 2018, though he was suspended for the team's bowl game for violating team rules.

Xavier Jones,"It did not take Jones long to make an impact after driving the three hours from Spring, Texas, to the SMU campus. He started 6 of 12 games played and set a school record in 2015 by scoring 10 rushing touchdowns as a true freshman (152-634-4.2 rushing; 27-214-7.9 receiving). Injuries to his hamstring and shoulder limited him to two games in 2016 (15-140-9.3, one TD rushing), when he received a medical redshirt. Jones bounced back to lead the Mustangs in rushing in 2017, starting 12 of 13 games, covering 1,075 yards and scoring nine times on 182 carries (5.9 average), and catching 14 passes for 84 yards (6.0 average). He had a lesser role on offense as a junior (69-311-4.2, two TDs rushing; 10-95-9.5 receiving, one start in 10 games) but became ""the man"" for the Mustangs in 2019. Jones was a first-team All-American Athletic Conference selection as a senior, leading his team with 1,276 yards (244 carries, 5.2 per) and finishing among the nation's leaders with 23 touchdowns in 13 starts.",5.41,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xavier-jones/32004a4f-4e82-4738-d683-10104f6b4e56
Auzoyah Alufohai,"Auzoyah Alufohai (pronounced ah-ZOY-ah ah-LOOF-oh-hai) moved around a lot as a youth, making stops in Texas, Nigeria, Malaysia and Georgia with his family because of his father's job (worked for Shell). He played football for the first time as a high school senior, which meant his potential was not fully appreciated in the recruiting world. Kennesaw State saw the potential, especially after he got into true football shape. Alufohai started three of eight games played as a true freshman but made only three tackles (one for loss). His production increased his sophomore season (13 stops, two starts in 10 games) and then he became a 14-game starter for the Owls in 2017 (31 tackles, 1.5 for loss, two pass breakups).

Avery played football at Cane Ridge High School in Nashville, and then one year at Independence Community College (13 tackles in 10 games).

BYU coaches switched him to linebacker after that campaign, and he wound up starting 12 games there (80 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two sacks, three interceptions, one returned for a score, three pass breakups). However, Bernard was not allowed to play in the team's bowl game due to a violation of team rules. He was already sitting out the 2017 season for allegedly violating the school's honor code before being arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. Bernard asked for his release from BYU when told he would not return that season; he attended Rio Salado College while waiting for his next opportunity. Utah signed him before the 2018 campaign and he started two of 12 games played in his first year with the Utes (38 tackles, five for loss, an interception, two pass breakups).

Kelly Bryant,"One would think that a starting quarterback with a 5-0 record would not be in danger of losing his job, especially one who was named the ACC Championship Game Most Valuable Player the year before. Alas, Bryant was unfortunate to be on the same roster as phenom Trevor Lawrence, who eventually led Clemson to a national title. Bryant left the Tigers midway through that frustrating season and picked Missouri as his new home for the 2019 season (and stayed despite a bowl ban for his new Tigers). He started 10 games for Missouri, playing through knee and hamstring injuries to complete 62 percent of his passes (181 of 292) for 2,215 yards and 15 touchdowns against six interceptions (also 106-242-2.3, one TD rushing).

The cousin of former Clemson and NFL receiver Martavis Bryant excelled in his first year as a starter in 2017, starting all 14 games (12-2 record), completing 65.8 percent of his passes (262 of 398, ranking 10th in the FBS) for 2,802 yards and 13 scores (with eight interceptions). He also made hay with his feet (192-665-3.5, 11 TDs).

As a senior, he was an American Football Coaches Association second-team All-American and first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference selection with 15 receptions for 199 yards and five scores in 15 games (14 starts). His efforts as a blocker were part of the reason for the team's strong rushing attack. Ellefson was a second-team all-conference pick as a junior (14-194-13.9, eight TDs in 15 games, 14 starts). He was used primarily as a blocker as a redshirt freshman and sophomore, playing in all 29 games (6-70-11.7, three TDs in 2017). The Hawley, Minnesota, native was a first-team all-state pick as a senior for his prowess on offense and defense. He was a four-year starter and the school's all-time leading scorer in basketball, too.

Jalen Elliott,"Elliott was a high school quarterback but recruiting services rated him at safety, ""athlete,"" and receiver. He had five interceptions as a senior at Lloyd C. Bird High School in Richmond, Virginia, so those projecting him to defensive back appeared to have it right. Elliott led the Irish with four picks as a junior, along with 67 tackles and seven pass breakups in 13 starts. He started all 13 games as a senior, recording 49 tackles, two interceptions, and two pass breakups.

He had started seven of 13 games played at that left guard spot the previous season, and six games there as a redshirt freshman (10 games total) before a broken ankle ended his season prematurely. Higby only played in seven games in 2019, however, with four starts at left tackle before shutting it down due to injury.

Jennings started nine games as a sophomore, collecting 40 passes for 580 yards and seven scores in 13 appearances. His 2017 season at Rocky Top was a bit rocky, as he suffered a wrist injury in the opener after catching three passes for 17 yards. He did not end up playing the rest of the year, though he went to social media to rip coaches for not putting him back on the field late in the season. Interim head coach Brady Hoke dismissed him from the team after that incident, but the new coaching staff brought him back in the spring of 2018 (though a knee injury kept him from practicing). Jennings returned to the starting lineup for five games in 2018 (30 receptions, 438 yards, 14.6 average, three touchdowns in 12 contests).

Siposs' play was steady in 2019, averaging 43.8 yards per attempt, making returners fair-catch 27 of those boots and placing 16 inside the 20-yard line (versus three touchbacks).",5.4,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/arryn-siposs/32005349-5045-9786-3e48-7b370e881b3e
Rashad Smith,"Smith hopes to join family member Alfred Fincher Jr. as an NFL linebacker. The Florida City, Florida, native only had to move about 80 miles north to play for the Owls. He looked comfortable as a freshman, starting two of 10 games played (22 tackles, two for loss). Smith was a full-time starter as a sophomore, racking up 99 stops, 12 for loss, and five pass breakups. Conference USA coaches voted him honorable mention all-conference in 2018 after he posted 86 stops, 5.5 for loss, and a team-high four interceptions. Smith was also an honorable mention all-conference pick as a senior (109 tackles, 11.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks, three interceptions, two pass breakups, FBS-leading five fumble recoveries).",5.4,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashad-smith/3200534d-4959-0351-f6c4-bfa762e7bb26

He redshirted the 2014 season after a stellar high school career as a first-team All-Georgia selection in football and star baseball player (his father, Patrick, coached him on both teams). Smith showed great promise as a redshirt freshman, starting seven of 12 games played (157 carries, 670 yards, 4.3 average, two touchdowns; 16 receptions, 124 yards, 7.8 average). He became a star in 2016, receiving third-team All-Big Ten honors after starting 12 of 13 games played, rushing for 1,158 yards and 16 touchdowns on 240 carries (4.8 per), catching 23 passes for 188 yards (8.2 per), and returning kicks (eight returns, 263 yards, 32.9 average, one touchdown).

He garnered honorable mention All-Big 12 honors as a 13-game starter in 2018, racking up 69 stops, eight for loss, two interceptions, and three pass breakups. League coaches voted him honorable mention all-conference again as a senior, as he led his team with 92 tackles (eight for loss, 2.5 sacks) and broke up seven passes. Those efforts followed an honorable mention all-conference sophomore campaign (107 tackles, 8.5 for loss, two interceptions, three pass breakups and two forced fumbles) capped by winning the Liberty Bowl Defensive Player of the Game award. The three-sport star from Olathe North HS (football, wrestling, track thrower) redshirted his first season with the Cyclones and then played in 11 games as a reserve (four tackles).

He transferred to Montana State to play for his former coach at UW, Jeff Choate. In his first year with the Bobcats, Sterk started all 13 games and was named second-team All-Big Sky Conference for his efforts (61 tackles, 17 for loss, 8.5 sacks, two pass breakups).

Darrell Stewart,"Stewart was an all-district, all-purpose threat as a runner, thrower and receiver at Houston's Nimitz High School before heading north to join the Spartans. He redshirted in 2015 and then contributed in 10 games (one start) the following season (3-29-9.7 receiving, 5-107-21.4 kick returns). Stewart became a major part of the offense during his sophomore campaign, starting four of 13 games played but raking in 50 throws for 501 yards (10.0 per) and two scores (also 6-152-25.3 kick returns; 6-20-3.3 punt returns). His statistics as a junior were not as impressive (48-413-8.6, one TD receiving in 11 games with eight starts; 4-117-29.3 kick returns), but Spartans coaches named him the team's Most Improved Offensive Player in 2018.

Khalil Tate,"Tate and his teammate with the Wildcats, running back J.J. Taylor, were California Mr. Football finalists in 2015. Tate, one of the top dual-threat quarterback recruits in the country coming out of Juniper Serra High School, intended to redshirt his first year in Tucson despite the fact he enrolled a semester early. He was forced into action, however, for seven games (one start) due to injuries at the position (18-45-40.0, 243 yards, three TDs, three INTs; 7-49-7.0, one TD rushing). That experience came in handy the following season, as Tate was again forced into action midway through the year. He started the final eight contests, making plays with his arm (111-179-62.0, 1,591 yards, 14 TDs, nine INTs in 12 games overall) and making headlines with his feet (153-1,411-9.2, 12 TDs). He ranked ninth in the FBS with 8.9 yards per pass attempt but ranked first with 9.2 yards per rush and fourth with 128.3 rushing yards per game (including 327 yards against Colorado, an FBS record for QBs). He was a finalist for the Manning Award as the nation's top quarterback that year. Tate's junior year under a new head coach (Rich Rodriquez was replaced by Kevin Sumlin) was not as successful on the ground (74-224-3.0, two TDs), though he fought an ankle injury, as well. He passed more often, however (170-302-56.3, 2,530 yards, 26 TDs, eight INTs). His senior year did not go as planned, either, as his passing numbers were mediocre for the 4-8 Wildcats (160-266-60.2, 1,954 yards, 14 TDs, 11 INTs) even though he caused more damage on the ground (90-413-4.6, three TDs) in 11 games (nine starts). Tate has said he played through a hamstring pull for much of the season. Tate told the Arizona Daily Star in January that he was asked by NFL coaches if he was willing to switch positions at the next level. He stated that his goal is to be an NFL quarterback, but he would consider other options if it doesn't work out.",5.4,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/khalil-tate/32005441-5435-8658-1589-9729b95b9c79

He played in all 13 games as a true freshman, though, making three tackles. Welch suited up for 11 contests in 2017 (six tackles, one interception) before finally finding himself in a starting role in 2018. He lined up with the ones six times as a junior (three at Mike, three at Will) and posted 49 stops, 1.5 sacks, and one interception. Though Welch only played in 10 games (all starts) in 2019 due to a shoulder injury, he still led Iowa with 87 tackles (nine for loss, three sacks) while also breaking up three passes to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades from league coaches.",5.4,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kristian-welch/32005745-4c11-6744-5e96-0d6cce8c69e2

Despite missing four games with a broken left hand, White still managed to lead MSU in receiving as a sophomore (42-555-13.2, two TDs; also 5-23-4.6 punt returns) in nine starts.

Nate Wieting,"Wieting finally got his chance to shine in Iowa's offense in 2019 after the early departures of T.J. Hockensen and Noah Fant to the NFL. He was used more as a blocker than a receiver, but still grabbed 10 passes for 117 yards (11.7 per) in 11 games (10 starts). The Rockford, Illinois, product actually started three games as a redshirt freshman walk-on but caught no passes and was primarily a blocker. Wieting injured his shoulder late in the year and underwent three surgeries (shoulder, knee, foot) in the offseason. He re-injured that shoulder in fall camp and missed half of the 2017 season. His only catch was a big one, though, as he set up the team's game-winning touchdown against Boston College in the Pinstripe Bowl.

Devwah Whaley,"Whaley never rushed for more than 700 yards in a season while in Fayetteville, but NFL scouts still have interest in his talents. He was a four-star recruit and top 70 overall prospect nationally out of Beaumont, Texas, receiving scholarship offers from several SEC, Big 12 and Pac-12 schools. In fact, Whaley was committed to Georgia before Mark Richt resigned, and switched to Arkansas. Whaley played in all 13 games as a true freshman, rushing for 602 yards and scoring three times on 110 carries (5.5 average) while catching six passes for 139 yards (23.2). Razorbacks coaches started him in 11 of 12 games in his sophomore campaign (127-559-4.4, seven TDs rushing; 8-56-7.0, one TD receiving). Whaley started the first four games of the 2018 season, but injuries limited him to seven games overall (82-368-4.5, two TDs rushing: 8-87-10.9 receiving). He played in all 12 games as a senior, finishing second on the team in rushing for the second straight year (69-278-4.0, four TDs rushing; 16-141-8.8 receiving).

Perry Young,"Young arrived in Cincinnati as a three-star safety prospect. He moved to linebacker while also starring on special teams as a true freshman for the Bearcats, posting 42 tackles (1.5 for loss). Young was a productive starter at Will linebacker as a sophomore in 11 of 12 games played (101 tackles, team-high nine for loss, three pass breakups). Although he missed the final four games of his junior season with a torn ACL, Young was a first-team All-American Athletic Conference pick (45 tackles, 2.5 for loss). He repeated that honor as a senior, starting all 14 games (81 tackles, 8.5 for loss, one sack, two interceptions, four other pass breakups). His career ended on a high note, going back to his home city to help UC beat Boston College in the Birmingham Bowl.",5.1,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/perry-young/3200594f-5544-4415-292e-8b6b0ea5c2b2

As a redshirt freshman, he played in all 13 games on special teams and got one snap at guard. Paulo earned the right tackle job as a sophomore, starting 13 games there in both 2017 and 2018. He moved to the left side for his senior season. He started all 14 games on the blindside as a senior, garnering first-team All-Pac-12 honors for his play.",5,2020,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrin-paulo/32005041-5561-5581-e4f7-3df91bf058b3
Trevor Lawrence,"Lawrence broke Deshaun Watson's Georgia high school career passing yards (13,908) and passing touchdowns (161) records, won two state titles as a starter and was the USA Today National Player of the Year as a senior. Lawrence and fellow quarterback prospect Justin Fields (who started his collegiate career at Georgia before transferring to Ohio State) grew up 20 miles apart and were the top two prospects in the 2018 recruiting class. Lawrence stepped into the starting lineup for 11 of 15 games played in 2018, earning ACC Rookie of the Year and second-team all-conference honors while leading the Tigers to a national title (the first freshman quarterback to do so since Jamelle Holieway at Oklahoma in 1985). The Manning Award finalist completed 65.2 percent of his passes (259 of 397) for 3,280 yards and 30 touchdowns against four interceptions (60-177-3.0, one TD rushing). Lawrence and his Clemson teammates came up short in their effort to repeat as national champions against the LSU juggernaut in 2019 (18 of 37, 234 yards in the title game). However, he still garnered first-team All-ACC honors (268 of 407, 65.8%, 3,665 yards, 36 TDs, eight INTs; 103-563-5.5, nine TDs rushing in 15 starts) and was a finalist for the Sullivan Award, which goes to the nation's top amateur athlete. Lawrence was the ACC Offensive Player of the Year and a third-team Associated Press All-American in 2020. He was also a finalist for the Heisman Trophy and Maxwell, Davey O'Brien and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He started 10 games, ranking ninth in the FBS in completion percentage (231 of 334, 69.2%) and eighth with 315.3 passing yards per game (3,153 total with 24 TDs, five INTs; also 68-203-3.0, eight TDs rushing), missing two games after testing positive for COVID-19. Lawrence decided to hold his pro day on Feb. 12 rather than wait for Clemson's pro day a month later. The earlier workout date gave him more time to recover from the Feb. 16 surgery on an injury to the labrum of his left (non-throwing) shoulder. The timeframe for recovery is five to six months. -- by Chad Reuter",7.4,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevor-lawrence/32004c41-5751-4099-56fc-f565c8d26c06
Kyle Pitts,"Pitts, who grew up in Philadelphia, transferred to Archbishop Wood High School after his sophomore year and moved from quarterback to tight end. Pitts committed to Florida and got on the field for 11 games as a reserve in 2018, catching three passes for 73 yards (24.3 per) and a score. His sophomore campaign was outstanding, as he led the Gators with 54 catches for 649 yards (12.0 per) and scored five times in 13 games (12 starts) to earn first-team All-SEC accolades. Pitts became a superstar in 2020, winning the John Mackey award (top TE) and earning Associated Press first-team All-American honors. He was also the first tight end to be named a Fred Biletnikoff award (top WR) finalist after catching 43 passes for 770 yards (17.9 per) and 12 receiving touchdowns (tied for third-most in the FBS) in eight starts. Pitts missed three games due to a concussion/facial injury and decided not to play in Florida's bowl game. -- by Chad Reuter",7.19,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-pitts/32005049-5451-6805-5aec-d4afcbd52e25
DeVonta Smith,"Smith arrived in Tuscaloosa as a five-star recruit and top-10 receiver prospect nationally. He played in all 14 games as a freshman, but he caught just eight passes for 160 yards (20.0 per) and three scores. His final catch of the year, though, was the national title game-winner from fellow freshman Tua Tagovailoa in overtime. The Louisiana native started 10 of 14 games played as a sophomore, becoming a regular target for Tagovailoa, with 42 catches for 693 yards (16.5 per) and six touchdowns. In 2019, Smith was a second-team Associated Press All-American and second-team all-SEC selection. He led the Tide with 1,256 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns (on 68 catches, 18.5 per), including an 11-catch performance for a school-record 274 yards and five scores against Ole Miss. His decision to return for 2020 paid off in a major way. ""Smitty"" won the Heisman Trophy as well as the Biletnikoff and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He was a first-team Associated Press All-American and the SEC Offensive Player of the Year (and first-team all-conference). Smith led the FBS with 23 receiving touchdowns, which put him fifth in the career all-time list nationally (46 in four years) and first in the SEC annals. He also led the country in receptions (117) and receiving yards (1,856). He became the record-holder in career receiving yards in the SEC. Smith also returned 11 punts for 237 yards (21.5 per) and a score but did not qualify for the FBS leaderboard. Smith finished the year strong, earning MVP of the College Football Playoff semifinal win over Notre Dame (seven receptions, 130 yards, three TDs) and then excelling in the first half of the national title game (12 receptions, 215 yards, three TDs) against Ohio State before going to the sideline with a dislocated finger. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl but did not participate in practices or the game due to the injury. -- by Chad Reuter",7.13,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devonta-smith/3200534d-4920-6016-573c-fcc767bafc4d
Ja'Marr Chase,"Chase was awarded the coveted No. 7 jersey (worn by Patrick Peterson, Tyrann Mathieu, Grant Delpit, D.J. Chark and Leonard Fournette) for 2020 but decided to opt out of the season. He had little to prove after winning the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top receiver in 2019, helping LSU to a national title (nine receptions, 221 yards, two touchdowns in the championship game against Clemson). Chase led the FBS and set SEC records with 1,780 receiving yards and 20 receiving touchdowns (on 84 receptions) in 14 starts. As a true freshman in 2018, Chase started seven of 13 games (23 receptions, 313 yards, 13.6 average, three touchdowns), including the final five contests. His success was unsurprising, as the first-team all-state and New Orleans All-Metro pick was rated among the top 20 receiver prospects nationally coming out of high school. -- by Chad Reuter",7.12,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ja-marr-chase/32004348-4169-4469-b021-d2c20a7d7cf5
Pat Surtain II,"Not only is Surtain the son of the former Pro Bowl cornerback of the same name, but he also played for his father at American Heritage High School in Florida before joining the Tide. The top-10 overall recruit stepped in for Alabama to start 12 of 15 games in 2018, garnering SEC All-Freshman Team honors (37 tackles, 1.5 for loss, one interception, seven pass breakups). Surtain started all 13 games in 2019, racking up 42 tackles, two interceptions, eight pass breakups and three forced fumbles. His play as a shutdown corner not only helped Alabama win a national title in 2020, but also earned him first-team Associated Press All-American and SEC Defensive Player of the Year honors. Surtain started all 13 games and led the squad with 12 pass breakups (also 38 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one interception).

He also finished as a finalist for the Pennsylvania Mr. Football Class 4A-6A award (17.5 TFL, 10.5 sacks, 1,239 rushing yards). It did not take long for the Harrisburg product to make an impact for the Nittany Lions, as he led the team in tackles (83, five for loss, with 1.5 sacks) and was named a Freshman All-American despite starting only one of 13 games played in 2018. Parsons led the team in tackles (109, 14 for loss, with five sacks, five pass breakups) and tied for fourth in the FBS with four forced fumbles as a sophomore, garnering first-team Associated Press All-American honors for his play in 13 games (12 starts). He was named a first-team All-Big Ten selection, as well, and the conference's Linebacker of the Year.

Jaylen Waddle,"Waddle was a top-40 overall recruit out of Episcopal High School in Houston before making plays for the Tide. He was a strong contributor on offense (45 receptions, 848 yards, 18.8 average, seven touchdowns) and special teams (16 punt returns, 233 yards, 14.6 average, one TD) as a freshman in 2018, starting three of 15 games played. Waddle was part of one of the best receiving corps in college football history in 2019. He only started three of 13 games played (33 receptions, 560 yards, 17.0 average, six TDs) because he was playing behind two first-round picks in Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III, as well as 2020 Heisman Trophy winner DeVonta Smith. Waddle earned 2019 second-team Associated Press All-American and SEC Special Teams Player of the Year honors by leading the FBS in punt return average (20 returns, 487 yards, 24.4 average, one TD) and also scoring once on a kick return (five returns, 175 yards, 35.0 average). His junior season started off with a bang (28 receptions, 591 yards, 21.2 average, four TDs; four kick returns, 39 yards, 9.8 average; two punt returns, 13 yards, 6.5 average), but a broken ankle suffered while returning a kickoff against Tennessee cost him six games. The second-team All-SEC kick returner suited up for the national title game, limping at times as he contributed (three receptions, 34 yards, 11.3 average) to the team's win over Ohio State. -- by Chad Reuter",6.86,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylen-waddle/32005741-4408-8683-c826-c882ad6fd5c2

Owusu-Koramoah led Notre Dame with 13.5 tackles for loss and tied for the team lead with 80 tackles and 5.5 sacks while posting four pass breakups and two forced fumbles in 13 games. He finished the year on a strong note with three sacks in the Camping World Bowl against Iowa State. ""JOK"" made national headlines with his play as a junior, winning the Butkus Award as the country's top linebacker (also a finalist for the Bednarik Award and Nagurski Trophy) and being named a first-team Associated Press All-American and ACC Defensive Player of the Year.

Sewell became the first Oregon true freshman to start a season opener in 20 years; he started seven games that year at left tackle but missed six games due to an ankle injury. His talent truly shined in 2019, as the 13-game starter at left tackle won the Outland Trophy (first sophomore offensive lineman and first Polynesian player to receive the award). He was also a unanimous All-American and the Polynesian College Football Co-Player of the Year. Sewell opted out of the 2020 season.

His father, Mike, played defensive tackle at Utah under current Utes head coach Kyle Whittingham (who was then the D-line coach), but they already had a quarterback recruited for the 2018 class. So, Wilson signed with arch-rival BYU and started seven of nine games played as a true freshman (120-of-182, 65.9% completion rate, 1,578 yards, 12 TDs, three INTs passing; 75-211-2.9, two TDs rushing), finishing the season with a Famous Idaho Potato Bowl MVP effort (18-of-18, 317 yards, four TDs).

Najee Harris,"Harris did not start a contest in his first two years with the Tide because of the team's depth at the position. He carried the ball just 61 times as a freshman, rushing for 370 yards (6.1 per) and three scores, and caught six passes for 45 yards (7.5 per) for the national champions. Harris nearly doubled his workload as a sophomore with 117 totes for 783 yards (6.7 per) and four touchdowns (four catches for seven yards receiving). Harris was suspended for the first quarter of the 2019 season opener, reportedly for missing a team function. He started the other 12 games of his junior year, garnering second-team All-SEC honors by covering 1,224 yards and scoring 13 times on 209 carries (5.9 per) while also catching 27 passes for 304 yards (11.3 per) and seven touchdowns.

Justin Fields,"Fields was Mr. Football in Georgia as a senior at Harrison High School, so it was natural for him to accept UGA's offer as one of the top recruits in the country.

He decided to move on to Ohio State in January 2019, as Fromm was expected to start again that year. Fields was granted a waiver from the NCAA that allowed him to play immediately for the Buckeyes. He earned Heisman Trophy finalist, second-team Associated Press All-American and Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors as a sophomore, ranking third in the country in touchdown throws (41, against just three interceptions) and fourth in passing efficiency rating (181.4) in 14 starts. He was named MVP of the Big Ten Championship Game after throwing for 299 yards and three TDs in a win over Wisconsin before losing to Clemson in the national semifinals. Fields was quite familiar with Tigers quarterback Trevor Lawrence as they grew up 20 miles apart in Georgia and were considered the top two prospects in the 2018 recruiting class. Fields took Ohio State a step closer to a national title in 2020, winning Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year for the second straight season.

Elijah Moore,"Moore was a four-star recruit from famed St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale before signing with Ole Miss. It did not take long for him to become a factor in the Rebels' offense, starting four of 12 games as a true freshman (36 receptions, 398 yards, 11.1 average, two touchdowns) and also contributing as a returner (12 kick returns, 222 yards, 18.5 average; 10 punt returns, 34 yards, 3.4 average). Moore led the team in receiving in 2019, grabbing 67 passes for 850 yards (12.7 per) and six scores. He also returned 14 punts for 90 yards (6.4 per) but might have been best known for infamously celebrating his touchdown catch with just four seconds remaining catch against rival Mississippi State by mimicking a urinating dog in the end zone. His celebration drew a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed back an extra point attempt that was no good and allowed MSU to win the annual Egg Bowl by one point. Moore made national headlines for the right reasons in 2020, leading the FBS with 10.8 receptions and 149.1 receiving yards per game. He set a school record with 86 receptions (breaking current Tennessee Titans receiver A.J. Brown's record) for 1,193 yards and eight scores. Moore also rushed for 64 yards on 14 attempts (4.6 per) in his eight starts on his way to first-team Associated Press All-American, first-team All-SEC and Biletnikoff Award finalist honors.

The first-team all-state and San Francisco Chronicle All-Metro selection from Oakland's Bishop O'Dowd High School played in all 12 games as a reserve his redshirt freshman season. Given the chance to start all 13 games at left guard in 2019, he not only garnered second-team All-Pac-12 notice but won the team's Offensive Lineman of the Year Award over stud left tackle and 2020 first-round pick Austin Jackson. Vera-Tucker initially opted out of the 2020 season but decided to opt back in when the Pac-12 announced it would have a fall football season instead of playing in the spring.

Landon Dickerson,"Considered one of the top offensive tackle recruits in the country out of North Carolina, Dickerson signed with Florida State for the 2016 season. He became the first true freshman offensive lineman to start for FSU since Jamie Dukes in 1982, starting the first seven games of the year at right guard before an ACL injury ended his season. The following year, Dickerson started the first four games at left guard before an ankle malady sidelined him. Another ankle problem stopped his 2018 season after only one start at right tackle. Looking for a change of scenery, Dickerson transferred to Alabama for the 2019 campaign. The new home proved more hospitable, as he was named a second-team All-SEC performer as a 13-game starter (four at right guard, nine at center) in his first year in Tuscaloosa. His outstanding play as a senior landed him the Rimington Trophy as the nation's best center, as well as first-team Associated Press All-American and all-conference honors. Dickerson also shared the SEC Jacobs Blocking Trophy with teammate Alex Leatherwood and helped the line win the Joe Moore Award as the top group in the country. He started the first 11 games of the year but suffered a knee injury in the SEC Championship Game win over Florida that required surgery. After sitting out the team's playoff semifinal win over Notre Dame, he returned as a team captain (their lone representative at the coin toss) in the national title game and then finished the game snapping in the victory formation. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl but was not able to participate due to the injury. -- by Chad Reuter",6.42,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/landon-dickerson/32004449-4328-1359-550c-3144f603cda4

Newsome missed the end of the 2019 season due to injury, as well, but still led the Wildcats with 11 pass breakups in nine games (eight starts, also made 36 tackles). His play in the first six games of the shortened 2020 season (12 tackles, one interception, team-high 10 pass breakups) earned him third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten status.

He has helped the Bison stretch their great success at the FCS level (eight titles in nine years) over the past couple of seasons, landing first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team Missouri Valley Football Conference honors his junior year as a 16-game starter at left tackle. Radunz was a second-team all-conference pick as a sophomore, starting all 15 games on the blindside. He anticipated contributing as a redshirt freshman in 2017 but missed all but one contest due to a knee injury. He started NDSU's lone game in the fall (the rest of the 2020 season was postponed until spring) and has accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. -- by Chad Reuter",6.25,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dillon-radunz/32005241-4474-6980-c89b-244c397a20de
Robert Rochell,"Rochell (pronounced row-SHELL) was a fantastic athlete in high school, earning All-District honors in football for Fair Park High School in Shreveport and finishing third in the 100-meter dash at the Louisiana state track meet. He started three times in 11 appearances for the Bears as a redshirt freshman (eight tackles, one interception, six pass breakups). In 2018, he started eight of 11 contests played (25 tackles, three for loss, four interceptions, six pass breakups). Rochell had a breakout junior campaign, when he tied for 10th in the FCS with five interceptions and garnered first-team All-Southland Conference honors with 44 tackles, 2.5 for loss, and a team-high 13 pass breakups. UCA played a nine-game schedule in 2020 and Rochell started seven of those contests (27 tackles, three pass breakups), missing two due to injury.

Amari Rodgers,"The son of former Tennessee and NFL quarterback Tee Martin nearly signed with USC, where Martin was coaching at that time. He decided to move from Knoxville to Clemson, however, as a top-100 national recruit and two-time Tennessee Mr. Football Award winner. Rodgers played in 14 games as a true freshman (19 receptions, 123 yards, 6.5 average; two punt returns, 15 yards, 7.5 average) before moving into the starting lineup for all 15 games during the team's national championship season. He garnered honorable mention All-ACC honors as an all-purpose player in 2018 (55 receptions, 575 yards, 10.5 average, four touchdowns; 39 punt returns, 299 yards, 7.7 average, one touchdown). Rodgers suffered a torn ACL the following March but only missed one game of his junior year (10 starts in 14 appearances) to garner honorable mention all-conference accolades as a receiver (30 receptions, 426 yards, 14.2 average, four touchdowns) and all-purpose player (18 punt returns, 151 yards, 8.4 average, two rushes, 50 yards, one touchdown). With the departure of Tee Higgins and the loss of Justyn Ross due to injury, Rodgers became Trevor Lawrence's top target in 2020, leading the Tigers with 77 receptions and 1,020 receiving yards (13.3 per) while tying for the team lead with seven touchdown catches. The first-team All-ACC selection also scored once as a rusher (2-50-25.0) and returned punts (nine returns, 64 yards, 7.1 average).

Trey Smith,"Henry Louis ""Trey"" Smith III has gone through much adversity since high school but continues to battle. His mother, Dorsetta, passed away from congestive heart failure when he was at the University School at Jackson in Tennessee. While there, he excelled on the gridiron, winning the Mr. Football Award twice and garnering a first-team All-American and top-10 overall recruit rating nationally. The Volunteers kept him in-state, and he received second-team All-SEC, Freshman All-American, and SEC All-Freshman recognition as a 12-game starter (eight at right guard, four at left tackle). After the season, however, he was diagnosed with blood clots in his lungs. Smith fought through that malady to return for the 2018 campaign but had to stop after seven starts at left tackle as doctors believed the clots had returned. However, additional study of those test results showed that doctors might have actually seen scar tissue from the previous clots. Smith worked hard in the offseason, losing 40 pounds, and he garnered 2019 first-team All-SEC honors after moving inside to left guard, where he started 12 of 13 games played. He was a first-team all-conference selection again in 2020, starting all 11 games at left guard for the Volunteers. He received the Jason Witten Award for leadership on the field and community service off the field, as well as the Fritz Pollard Trophy for extraordinary courage and community values. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. -- by Chad Reuter",6.25,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-smith/3200534d-4976-4701-9935-2cd0c0d35dd1
Tylan Wallace,"Twins Tylan and Tracin Wallace arrived in Stillwater in 2017, with Tylan earning four-star rankings and a spot among the top 75 prospects in the country after ranking among Texas' all-time leaders with 3,670 receiving yards. Tracin suffered three ACL injuries during his time in Stillwater, however, leading him to retire from football in June 2019. Tylan's career began quietly, playing in all 13 games as a reserve his true freshman year (seven receptions, 118 yards, 16.7 average). The departure of James Washington and Marcell Ateman to the NFL opened the door for Wallace in 2018. He finished his sophomore campaign with 86 receptions (tied for sixth in the FBS) for 1,491 yards (second) and 12 touchdowns, garnering second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big 12 honors. He was also a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award (top WR). Tylan suffered his own ACL injury in October 2019, shortening a junior campaign, when he ranked fourth in the FBS in receiving yards per game through eight weeks (53 receptions, 903 yards, 17.0 average, eight touchdowns). He was still named second-team All-Big 12 and shared the Cowboys' Most Outstanding Offensive Player Award with offensive tackle Teven Jenkins despite missing the final month of the season. As a senior, he led his team with 59 catches, 922 yards (15.6 per) and six touchdowns in 10 games (nine starts) on the year, garnering first-team All-Big 12 honors. Wallace played in the first half of Oklahoma State's bowl game, then sat out the second half to avoid injury as the team had planned going into the game. -- by Chad Reuter",6.25,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tylan-wallace/32005741-4c50-5238-e142-218e3028b910
Milton Williams,"In his first year of action with the Bulldogs (redshirted as a true freshman in 2017), Williams played in seven games and made three tackles. He made a much larger impact in 2019, however, earning honorable mention All-Conference USA honors in 13 starts (59 tackles, nine for loss, 5.5 sacks). Williams became one of the best defenders in C-USA in 2020, receiving first-team all-conference accolades by leading Tech with 10 tackles for loss with 4.5 sacks among 44 total tackles in 10 starts. -- by Chad Reuter",6.25,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/milton-williams/32005749-4c45-4157-cbf6-f99ade2bc77d
Wyatt Davis,"Davis was one of the top recruits in the country in 2017, named the Los Angeles Times' Southern California Player of the Year as an offensive tackle at St. John Bosco High School while also winning the U.S. Army's Glenn Davis Award for excellence in community service, education and athletic distinction. Ohio State nabbed the five-star recruit, and he redshirted in 2017. He played in all 14 games of the 2018 season but did not start at right guard until the final two games of the year. Davis started all 15 games for the Buckeyes at right guard in 2019, playing well enough to earn first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten accolades. He initially opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19 but decided to opt back in when the Big Ten announced it would have a fall football season instead of playing in the spring. Davis was once again a first-team AP All-American and all-conference selection in 2020 for his play in eight starts at right guard. He helped lead the Buckeyes to the national championship game, but Davis was forced to leave that contest with an injury in the first half. His late grandfather, Willie, was a Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive lineman for the Green Bay Packers in the 1960s. Wyatt's father, Duane, played football at Missouri but struggled with knee injuries. He eventually became an actor, landing movie roles in ""The Program"" and ""Necessary Roughness"" as well as ""Beetlejuice,"" while also getting parts on TV shows like ""21 Jump Street"" and ""A Different World.""  Wyatt's brother, David, played football at Washington State and Cal. -- by Chad Reuter ",6.24,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/wyatt-davis/32004441-5681-4602-9757-9e8cd641cf0d

He was a first-team All-American Athletic Conference selection that year, leading UCF with 109 tackles (three for loss) while also breaking up three passes and forcing three fumbles in 13 starts. Grant was a first-team all-conference pick in 2019, as well (78 tackles, four for loss, one interception returned for a score, eight pass breakups in 12 starts). League coaches voted him at the top of the heap again for his play as a senior, when he led UCF with 72 tackles (3.5 for loss) and three interceptions while also breaking up six passes and forcing two fumbles in nine games (eight starts). Grant was also named a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl.

Josh Palmer,"Palmer grew up just outside of Toronto (his father, Keith, played in the Canadian Football League) but he moved to Florida before his junior year of high school to play at Fort Lauderdale powerhouse St. Thomas Aquinas. He was a second-team Class 7A all-state pick there as a senior, when the team won a state title. Palmer started six of 12 games played as a true freshman for the Volunteers in 2017 (nine receptions, 98 yards, 10.9 average).

Asante Samuel Jr.,"Samuel more than lived up to the hype when signing with in-state power Florida State as a top-25 overall recruit out of St. Thomas Aquinas High School. The son of four-time Pro Bowl selectee and two-time Super Bowl champion Asante Samuel signed his letter of intent with FSU two days after Signing Day to honor the anniversary of the passing of his maternal grandmother. Samuel led the Seminoles with nine pass breakups as a true freshman despite starting just three of 12 games played (17 tackles, one for loss). He was a third-team All-ACC selection in 2019, leading the conference with 14 pass breakups to go along with 48 tackles and an interception in 12 starts.

He also recorded 64 tackles, 3.5 for loss, to earn first-team All-Pac-12 plaudits. Adebo earned All-Pac-12 honors again in 2019 after leading his squad with four interceptions and 10 pass breakups (with 33 tackles) despite missing three games due to injury.

Divine Deablo,"Divine's parents gave him that name to honor his great-grandfather as well as to offset his devilish surname. The four-star prospect out of Winston-Salem started his career with the Hokies at wide receiver, also excelling on special teams as a true freshman in 2016 (four tackles; one catch for eight yards). Deablo redshirted the 2017 season after four games as a reserve safety (eight tackles, 1.5 for loss, one interception, three pass breakups) due to a broken foot. Deablo missed two games due to injury in 2018, as well, but started 11 contests (55 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two pass breakups). He started all 13 games at free safety in his junior campaign, recording 84 tackles, 4.5 for loss, one interception and two pass breakups.

They moved Moore to offensive tackle the following spring, and he played in five games as a reserve. He took over the starting job at left tackle for all 13 games of the 2018 season, where he would garner second-team All-MAC honors as a junior (13 starts) and senior (six).

Myers started all 14 games at center in 2019, a position he did not play in high school.

Snowden then stepped into a starting role in his sophomore campaign, recording 61 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks, two interceptions and seven pass breakups (which led all FBS linebackers). He began all 14 games in his junior campaign, garnering honorable mention All-ACC accolades (72 tackles, 11 for loss, with five sacks, four pass breakups).

Michael Carter,"Carter suffered a knee injury as a junior at Navarre High School in Florida, but he bounced back in a big way his senior year, winning the USA Today Offensive Player of the Year and Class 6A Mr. Football Awards by rushing for 2,536 yards and 45 touchdowns. UNC coaches put him to work as a true freshman, and he led the team with eight rushing touchdowns (97 carries, 559 yards, 5.8 yards per carry; 11 catches, 100 yards, 9.1 average, one touchdown) in 11 games with two starts.

He was recruited by major programs before he even reached high school and won the 2016 High School Butkus Award and Parade National Player of the Year. Moses enrolled at Tuscaloosa in January 2017 to get a head start, which paid off when he started twice in 11 games played as a true freshman (30 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks, one interception) for the national champions to garner SEC All-Freshman team notice. Moses suffered a foot injury in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff, however. That malady did not hinder his play in 2018, as he was a second-team all-conference selection and Butkus Award finalist after leading the Tide with 86 tackles (10 for loss, 3.5 sacks) in 15 starts. The injury bug hit Moses again in August 2019, as he missed the year after undergoing surgery on a torn ACL suffered during practice. Moses decided to return to Tuscaloosa for the 2020 season and his decision paid off, as he led the Tide's defense while the squad won another national championship. Moses garnered third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-SEC honors by leading Alabama with 80 tackles, 6.5 for loss, with 1.5 sacks and an interception despite playing through pain in his return from the knee injury. -- by Chad Reuter",6.21,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dylan-moses/32004d4f-5324-1011-695d-c9d89ae7f1f3

Walker Little,"Little was rated the No. 1 recruit in the country by 247 Sports coming out of Houston's Episcopal High School. He started one of nine games played at left tackle in 2017, garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors. Little was a first-team all-conference pick as a sophomore, starting all 13 games on the blindside. He started the first game of the 2019 season at left tackle but suffered a season-ending knee injury in that contest. Little opted out of the 2020 season.

Dyami Brown,"Dyami (pronounced dee-AH-mee) Brown made an impact for the Tar Heels as a true freshman, starting six of 10 contests played (17 receptions, 173 yards, 10.2 average, one touchdown) after enrolling a semester early as a four-star recruit and all-state receiver at Charlotte's West Mecklenburg High School. His game stepped up another level with Sam Howell playing quarterback at UNC in 2019, as he garnered third-team All-ACC honors by ranking ninth in the country with 20.3 yards per reception (51 receptions, 1,034 yards) and tying the school record with 12 receiving touchdowns in 13 starts. Brown was dynamic in 2020, as well, earning third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-ACC status by leading Carolina in receiving (55 receptions, 1,099 yards, 20.0 average, eight touchdowns) in 11 starts. He did not play in the team's bowl game.

Brady Christensen,"Christensen served a two-year church mission in New Zealand after excelling at Bountiful High School in Utah and then redshirted in 2017. He took over the starting left tackle spot in 2018, starting all 13 games. Christensen repeated that feat in 2019. He garnered national attention as a junior, blocking so well for star quarterback Zach Wilson in 12 starts that the Associated Press voted him a first-team All-American. -- by Chad Reuter",6.19,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brady-christensen/32004348-5206-5609-6e2c-c835b62c353f
Alim McNeill,"Alim (pronounced ah-LEEM) McNeill was a top 250 overall prospect nationally and decided to stay in Raleigh after starring at Sanderson High School, where he played inside linebacker and running back (at 250-plus pounds). He was also a three-time all-conference pick in baseball. McNeill made an impact as a true freshman in 2018 (24 tackles, 5.5 for loss, with 3.5 sacks, three pass breakups in 13 games, one start). He came on strong as a sophomore for the Wolfpack, starting the final eight games of the year (28 tackles, 7.5 for loss, with 5.5 sacks in 12 total appearances). His progress continued in 2020, when he became a second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-ACC selection (26 tackles, 4.5 for loss, one sack, one interception) while starting in 10 of 11 appearances. He did not play in his team's bowl game. -- by Chad Reuter",6.19,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alim-mcneill/32004d43-4e61-1247-5b50-75dcdd3e2757
Hamsah Nasirildeen,"Nasirildeen (pronounced naz-ril-deen) started twice in 13 appearances as a true freshman, breaking up three passes and recording 10 of his 29 total stops on the year against rival Clemson. Nasirildeen was Florida State's Most Improved Player in 2018, leading the squad with 91 stops while also intercepting a pass in 12 games (five starts). ACC coaches voted him second-team all-league in 2019 as FSU's leading tackler (101, two for loss). He also intercepted two passes, broke up three others and forced a team-high three fumbles. He missed the team's bowl game, however, due to a knee injury and also missed the first seven games of the 2020 season because of that malady. He returned to start the team's final two games (13 tackles, 1.5 for loss, one interception). He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. -- by Chad Reuter",6.19,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hamsah-nasirildeen/32004e41-5363-5310-e2a7-39ad93df1412
Kyle Trask,"Trask was the backup quarterback behind D'Eriq King (who starred at Houston before transferring to Miami for 2020) at Manvel High School, but Florida coaches offered him a scholarship, anyway. He did not see much action his first three years with the Gators, redshirting in 2016, sitting out the 2017 season due to a foot injury and playing in four games as a reserve (14 of 22 for 162 yards, one TD) behind Feleipe Franks in 2018. In 2019, Franks was injured in the SEC opener against Kentucky, which opened the door for Trask to lead UF to a comeback win. He helped the team win eight of his 10 starts, completing 66.9 percent of his passes (237 of 354) for 2,941 yards and 25 touchdowns against seven interceptions (also scored four times with his legs). That success bred even more success in 2020, as he garnered Heisman Trophy and Davey O'Brien Award finalist honors as well as second-team All-SEC honors. He led the FBS with a school-record 43 passing touchdowns and ranked second with 356.9 passing yards per game (school-record 4,283 total) in 12 starts (301 of 437, 68.9% completion rate, eight INTs).

Ben Cleveland,"Cleveland was a top-125 recruit nationally after earning a spot on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Super 11 team as a senior. He started the final five games of his redshirt freshman season at right guard after playing in the first 10 as a reserve. The following season, Cleveland started the first four games at right guard before missing six contests with a leg fracture that did not require surgery. He returned for spot duty in the final four games. Cleveland started seven of 13 games played at right guard in 2019, missing the Sugar Bowl because he was academically ineligible. Finally getting a chance as a regular starter (nine games) in 2020, he garnered third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-SEC honors for his play at right guard. Cleveland joined several teammates in opting out of the team's bowl game.

Trey Sermon,"Given Trey's last name, it's no surprise he has ""Trust"" tattooed on one bicep and ""God"" inked on the other. Oklahoma fans had been offering their praise to the heavens that Sermon signed with the Sooners as a top-100 overall recruit nationally from Marietta, Georgia. He enrolled a semester early and became an immediate contributor, starting three of 14 games played (121 carries, 744 yards, 6.1 yards per carry, five touchdowns; 16 receptions, 139 yards, 8.7 average, two touchdowns). Sermon started 12 of 14 games in 2018, garnering honorable mention All-Big 12 honors after leading the team with 13 rushing touchdowns (164 carries, 947 yards, 5.8 yards per carry; 12 receptions, 181 yards, 15.1 average). Injuries limited him in 2019, however, and he could only play in nine games with four starts (54 carries, 385 yards, 7.1 yards per carry, four touchdowns; eight receptions, 71 yards, 8.9 average, one touchdown). He transferred to Ohio State after the season; the Buckeyes were in the hunt for his services in the recruiting process out of high school. He rushed 116 times for 870 yards and four touchdowns (12 receptions, 95 yards, 7.9 average in eight games, two starts) in 2020. He came on strong at the end of the year, rushing for 331 yards in the Big Ten Championship Game and 193 yards in the College Football Playoff semifinal against Clemson (adding four receptions for 61 yards). Unfortunately, Sermon only carried once in the national title game before a shoulder injury sidelined him. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl but was not able to participate in practices or the game due to the injury. -- by Chad Reuter",6.18,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-sermon/32005345-5244-0716-5cc1-b1699fcf5156
Tyler Shelvin,"Shelvin struggled to find the field in his first two seasons with the Tigers, taking an academic redshirt in 2017 and then playing in just six games in 2018 (nine tackles, 1.5 sacks), when he missed time due to a suspension reportedly for failing to keep his weight down. The former five-star recruit began realizing his potential in the Tigers' national title run, however, starting 14 of 15 games and recording 39 tackles, three for losses, and two pass breakups. He opted out of the 2020 season. Shelvin played for former LSU linebacker Trev Faulk at Northside High School in Lafayette but transferred to Notre Dame High School (Crowley) in 2016 after Faulk resigned during his junior year. -- by Chad Reuter",6.18,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-shelvin/32005348-4545-6684-4da6-4d9633769e66

Long averaged 25.8 yards on four catches in his redshirt freshman season (103 total yards) and scored two touchdowns. He was a third-team all-conference pick in 2019 after leading the team with 509 yards on 28 receptions (18.2 per), scoring twice in 13 games (three starts). The second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-ACC selection in 2020 decided to leave for the NFL after racking up 57 receptions for 685 yards (12.0 per) and five scores in 11 starts for the Eagles. -- by Chad Reuter",6.17,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hunter-long/32004c4f-4e31-7078-2c2a-6aecda5dccae

As a redshirt freshman in 2017, he started the final nine games at right tackle. He was suspended in May 2018 by FSU for dating violence, and he eventually left the team to play at Butler Community College that fall. Ball moved on to Marshall for 2019, starting one game at right tackle in 13 appearances. The 2020 first-team All-Conference USA selection started eight games at left tackle, though he was ejected from the Conference USA Championship Game against UAB for incurring two personal foul penalties.

Michal Menet,"Michal Menet (pronounced michael men-NET) was rated among the top offensive linemen in the country after receiving first-team all-state honors as a sophomore, junior and senior at Exeter Township High School. He started 12 games in the pivot in 2018 after getting snaps in 12 games as a reserve his redshirt freshman season. He earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors in 2019, starting all 13 games in the middle. League coaches voted him third-team all-conference in 2020, rewarding the two-time team captain for his play in nine starts for the Nittany Lions.

Jordan Smith,"Smith signed with the University of Florida out of Lithonia High School in Georgia, where he was an all-state pick his senior season. He redshirted his first year in Gainesville before being suspended indefinitely in 2017 after he was alleged to have been involved with a credit card fraud scheme. Smith received two years of probation after pleading no contest to a third-degree felony. He transferred to Butler Community College (Kansas) for 2018, racking up 77 tackles, 22.5 for loss, with 11 sacks in 12 games for the Grizzlies. Smith signed with UAB in 2019, and the move paid immediate dividends as he earned second-team All-Conference USA honors after leading the squad with 17.5 tackles for loss and 10 sacks (among 53 total stops). He also tied for fourth in the nation with four forced fumbles in 14 games (13 starts). Smith was a first-team all-conference pick in 2020 after again leading the Blazers with 9.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks among 43 stops. He also intercepted one pass in nine starts.

Benjamin St-Juste,"St-Juste (pronounced saint joost) was rated the second-best recruit out of Canada in 2017, signing with Michigan. He played in 12 games as a reserve (three tackles) that fall and then redshirted the following fall due to a hamstring injury. A Michigan spokesman said in March 2019 that St-Juste would be medically retiring from football, but he instead transferred to Minnesota. He received a waiver to play immediately, starting nine of 13 games played for the Gophers (45 tackles, 1.5 for loss, team-high-tying 10 pass breakups). St. Juste started five games in 2020 (14 tackles, three pass breakups), missing two contests.

Tamorrion Terry,"Tamorrion (pronounced tuh-MAR-ee-on) Terry redshirted his first year with the Seminoles but made an immediate impact once on the field. The four-star recruit from Georgia was an honorable mention All-ACC pick and FSU's Offensive MVP in 2018 after leading the team in receiving yards and touchdowns (35-744-21.3, eight TDs in 12 games, 11 starts). Terry turned his game up a notch as a redshirt sophomore, garnering second-team All-ACC accolades as his team's leading receiver (60-1,188-19.8). He led the country by averaging 58 yards on his nine touchdown receptions. It was a mild surprise that Terry did not enter the 2020 NFL Draft, but he said he wanted to work with Florida State receivers coach (and former FSU wideout) Ron Dugans again in 2020. He could only manage five appearances (four starts), however, because of a knee injury (23-289-12.6, one TD receiving). He underwent surgery on the knee in October and opted out of the remainder of the season in early November. -- by Chad Reuter",6.15,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tamorrion-terry/32005445-5265-5932-d3d7-7449c0c1a7be
Pete Werner,"Werner flipped his recruiting commitment from Notre Dame to Ohio State after attending the 2016 Ohio State-Michigan game, though he has said that wasn't the only factor in the decision. The former first-team Class 6A All-State selection from Cathedral High School started 13 games for the Buckeyes as a sophomore (58 tackles, 7.5 for loss, with three sacks, seven pass breakups, two forced fumbles in 14 appearances), taking a big step forward from a freshman campaign where he was a reserve in 11 contests (nine tackles). He garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a junior in 2019, starting all 14 games and posting 64 stops, 5.5 for loss, three pass breakups and two fumble recoveries. Werner led the Buckeyes with 54 tackles (2.5 for loss with one sack, also forcing two fumbles) in 2020, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in eight starts for the national runners-up.

D'Wayne Eskridge,"Eskridge attended Bluffton High School in Indiana, where he was an honorable mention All-State pick as a running back as a senior and also the state's Mr. Track and Field in 2016. He won two state titles in the 200-meter dash and one in the 100-meter dash during his high school career. As a true freshman in 2017, he played in 12 games as a reserve (17 receptions, 121 yards, 7.1 average, one touchdown; six carries, 60 yards). He started all 12 contests in 2017 (30 receptions, 506 yards, 16.9 average, three touchdowns; four carries, 13 yards) and seven of 11 games at receiver in 2018 (38 receptions, 776 yards, 20.4 average, three touchdowns). Eskridge started two games at receiver and cornerback for the Broncos in 2019 (four receptions, 51 yards, 12.8 average; 14 tackles, four pass breakups), partially because NFL scouts thought it could be good for him to get experience on defense because of his stature. His season was cut short after suffering a clavicle injury in Week 4, however, so he redshirted. Eskridge returned to a receiver role full-time in 2020, garnering first-team All-MAC honors on offense and as a kick returner while also being named the MAC Special Teams Player of the Year. He led the FBS with 213 all-purpose yards per game (one carry, 27 yards; 17 kick returns, 467 yards, 27.5 average, one touchdown) and ranked fourth with 130.7 receiving yards per game and 23.1 yards per reception (34 receptions, 784 yards, eight touchdowns).

Costello in 2019, starting six of eight games played (158 of 241, 65.6 completion percentage, 1,960 yards, 11 touchdowns, five interceptions) and setting a school record with 504 passing yards against Washington State. Costello transferred to Mississippi State after the season, so the job was Mills' for 2020. The team captain garnered honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors, ranking fourth in the FBS with 25.8 completions per game in five starts (129 of 195, 66.2 completion percentage, 1,508 yards, seven touchdowns, three interceptions; three rushing touchdowns).

He suffered ligament damage in his left (non-throwing) arm in the playoffs his senior year, however, and redshirted his first year at UNC. He started seven games at quarterback in 2017 (107 of 183, 58.5 completion percentage, 1,342 yards, eight touchdowns, three interceptions in nine appearances), but appeared in only one game the following year (4 of 10, 40.0 completion percentage, 10 yards, three interceptions). With freshman Sam Howell taking over the reins of UNC's offense, Surratt made the switch to linebacker in the spring. All he did was finish as the runner-up for ACC Defensive Player of the Year and earn first-team all-conference honors after leading his squad with 115 tackles, 15 for loss, with 6.5 sacks, while also intercepting one pass and breaking up three others. While his brother Sage, a star receiver at Wake Forest, opted out of the 2020 season, Chazz started 11 games for UNC as a senior, garnering first-team All-ACC accolades with 91 tackles, 7.5 for loss, with six sacks, an interception and three pass breakups.

His father, Brian, played left tackle at Ferris State, but Jalen accepted a scholarship offer from the Wolverines.

Year 2 for the Golden Knights was even better, as he garnered honorable mention All-American Athletic Conference honors (49-830-16.9, seven TDs in 13 starts).

Khalil Herbert,"Herbert went from American Heritage High School in Florida (where he was named first-team All-Broward County as a senior) to Kansas as a three-star recruit in 2016. He contributed to the Jayhawks as a freshman (44 carries, 189 yards, 4.3 yards per carry, three touchdowns; six receptions, 42 yards, 7.0 average in eight games, three starts) and sophomore (120 carries, 663 yards, 5.5 yards per carry, four touchdowns; eight receptions, 38 yards, 4.8 average in 11 games, six starts). Herbert started only one game in 2018 (the season opener) because of the emergence of Pooka Williams Jr. (113 carries, 499 yards, 4.4 yards per carry, five touchdowns; nine receptions, 39 yards, 4.3 average in 12 contests). Seeing his playing time limited by Williams in 2019, Herbert decided to shut it down after four games (43 carries, 384 yards, 8.9 average, two touchdowns, two starts) to redshirt. His relationship with Kansas coaches deteriorated, however, leading him to transfer to Virginia Tech as a graduate student for 2020. Herbert had his best collegiate season for the Hokies, garnering third-team All-ACC honors at running back as well as second-team honors as an all-purpose player. He ranked fourth in the FBS with 7.7 yards per rush, fifth with 1,182 rushing yards (154 carries) and seventh with 162.8 all-purpose yards per game (10 receptions, 179 yards, 17.9 average, one touchdown; 16 kick returns, 430 yards, 26.9 average), starting nine of 11 contests.

Talanoa Hufanga,"Talanoa Hufanga (pronounced tal-uh-NOE-uh who-FAWN-guh) grew up in Corvallis, Oregon, but eschewed the Beavers (where his brother, T.J., played linebacker) and Ducks to go to USC, partially because he viewed it as ""basically a Polynesian school."" He was named the 2017 Polynesian High School National Player of the Year as a senior at Crescent Valley High School, where he was a two-time all-state pick. Hufanga played in the first eight games of the 2018 season, with five starts (51 tackles, 3.5 for loss, four pass breakups), but missed the end of the year and the following spring practice with a broken collarbone. He returned to garner second-team All-Pac-12 and team Co-Defensive Perimeter Player of the Year honors in 2019 (90 tackles, 7.5 for loss with 3.5 sacks, three pass breakups and two forced fumbles in 10 starts) despite missing one game with a concussion and two more contests with a shoulder sprain. Hufanga's excellent play in 2020 gained him first-team Associated Press All-American and Pac-12 Pat Tillman Defensive Player of the Year honors. The first-team all-conference selection tied for second in the FBS with 0.67 interceptions per game (four total) and tied for sixth with 6.7 solo tackles per game (40 total, 62 total tackles, 5.5 for loss) while also forcing two fumbles in six starts.

Another brother, Derrick, played football at Illinois and also spent time in the Milwaukee Brewers' minor league system. Emmanuel and Ezekiel, two other brothers, played football and minor league baseball, respectively, and his sister plays soccer at Wisconsin-Green Bay. Given all that athleticism in McPhearson's family, it's no surprise he excelled for Tech the past two seasons. McPhearson was a first-team All-Big 12 pick in 2020, leading his squad with four interceptions and breaking up six other passes to go along with 53 tackle in 10 starts. He started 12 games in 2019, as well (51 tackles, 2.5 for loss, five pass breakups, two blocked kicks). McPhearson actually signed with Penn State out of Riverdale Baptist High School in Maryland, where he also showed skills on the baseball diamond for a two-time national championship squad.

Wade enrolled at Columbus a semester early, but an abdomen injury forced him to redshirt the 2017 season. He excelled in a slot role in 2018, leading the Buckeyes with three interceptions, making 31 tackles, breaking up seven passes and playing in all 14 games (one start). Wade's play at nickel (14 games, nine starts) earned him third-team all-conference honors in 2019 (26 tackles, four for loss, two sacks, one interception, eight pass breakups). Wade was ejected for a targeting call in the team's College Football Playoff loss to Clemson. Wade initially decided to opt out of the 2020 season. When the Big Ten decided not to postpone its season until the spring, however, he decided to play his redshirt junior year.

Chuba Hubbard,"Chuba (pronounced CHOO-buh) Hubbard dominated his high school competition in Canada, rushing for 3,213 yards and 40 touchdowns as a junior.

He garnered first-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team all-conference accolades in addition to being named a finalist for the Walter Camp Player of the Year and Doak Walker Awards. In June 2020, Hubbard threatened to boycott team activities because OSU head coach Mike Gundy wore a T-shirt with the logo of the One America News Network, which is known as a far-right outlet. Gundy apologized to players later that week and committed to making changes. Hubbard started the first seven games of the 2020 season, garnering a second-team All-Big 12 nod despite a considerable drop in production (133 carries, 625 yards, 4.7 yards per carry, five touchdowns; eight receptions, 52 yards, 6.5 average, one touchdown).

Ihmir Smith-Marsette,"Ihmir Smith-Marsette (pronounced AH-meer Smith MAR-set) translated his all-purpose flair at Weequahic High School in New Jersey into similar production with the Hawkeyes. As a true freshman, he started in three of the 12 games he played (missing the Pinstripe Bowl due to an injury), contributing as a receiver (18-187-10.4, two TDs), runner (7-41-5.9) and kick returner (4-134-33.5). In Year 2, he was the Big Ten Return Specialist of the Year and his team's Special Teams Most Valuable Player, filling up the stat sheet even more (24-707-29.5 on kick returns; 23-361-15.7, three TDs receiving; 9-71-7.9 rushing). Prior to the 2019 campaign, Smith-Marsette actually promised that he would return a kickoff for a touchdown -- and made good with one in the regular-season finale, then added another in the team's bowl game. He was named honorable mention All-Big Ten pick after leading his squad in receiving yards and scores (44-722-16.4, five TDs), while continuing to contribute as a runner (11-108-9.8, two TDs) and kick returner (17-503-29.6). This past season, Smith-Marsette nabbed honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades for his work as a receiver (25-345-13.8, four TDs receiving; 7-54-7.7, one TD rushing) and kick returner (8-176-22.0). However, he was suspended for one game after an arrest for operating a vehicle while under the influence. And he also injured himself flipping himself into the end zone on a touchdown in the team's win over Wisconsin. -- by Chad Reuter",5.85,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ihmir-smith-marsette/3200534d-4982-9563-32f4-e8f3bd64568e
Chris Evans,"Evans was suspended for the 2019 season due to an academic issue, but stayed in Ann Arbor to take online courses, stay in shape and work. He was reinstated in 2020, though his usage in six games was limited (16 carries, 73 yards, 4.6 yards per carry, one touchdown; nine receptions, 87 yards, 9.7 average, one start). He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. His 2018 season was less than ideal, as he started just twice in 10 games (81 carries, 423 yards, 5.2 yards per carry, four touchdowns; 18 receptions, 148 yards, 8.2 average, one touchdown) while missing time with a leg strain. Evans was considered one of the top 15 running back recruits in the country out of Indianapolis' Ben Davis High School and made an immediate impact with the Wolverines by playing in all 13 games in 2016 (88 carries, 614 yards, 7.0 yards per carry, four touchdowns; six receptions, 87 yards, 14.5 average, one start). He garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors in 2017, rushing for 685 yards and six scores on 135 carries (5.1 per) and grabbing 16 passes for 157 yards (9.8 per) and a score. -- by Chad Reuter",5.84,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-evans/32004556-4110-5967-b1b8-845c260e1531

He led the team in rushing in 2018 (161-847-5.3, seven TDs in 13 games, eight starts) and 2019 (172-641-3.7, six TDs in 12 starts) while also making plays as a receiver in both seasons (2018: 26-253-9.7, two TDs; 2019: 21-192-9.1, two TDs). Jackson garnered second-team All-ACC honors as an all-purpose player in 2018 due to his kick return efforts (23-502-21.8). The 2020 team captain started all 11 games as a senior (161-682-4.2, five TDs rushing; 10-85-8.5 receiving). Jackson contributed as a true freshman, as well (29-89-3.1 rushing; 4-4-1.0 receiving; 2-39-19.5 kick returns in 12 games). Jackson's father, Deon, was a running back at the Citadel, while his mother, Tiffany, was a track athlete at Miami. -- by Chad Reuter",5.84,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deon-jackson/32004a41-4312-6714-526c-5f2fe97ca0c1
Adetokunbo Ogundeji,"Adetokunbo Ogundeji (pronounced ah-DAY-tok-uhn-bo oh-gun-day-gee) was just 17 years old when he enrolled at Notre Dame, and was injured as a senior at Walled Lake Central High School in Michigan. It was no surprise, then, that it took time for him to work his way into the rotation with the Irish. He played just five games as a redshirt freshman in 2017 (no statistics), then got more playing time in 13 games as a backup the following season (22 tackles, three for loss, with 1.5 sacks). Ogundeji only started one game as a junior in 2019, but posted 34 stops, seven for loss, with 4.5 sacks in 13 appearances, tying for the team lead with three forced fumbles. He was a team captain and 12-game starter as a senior, garnering honorable mention All-ACC honors in 2020 (23 tackles, team-high seven sacks).

Seth Williams,"Williams went to Paul ""Bear"" Bryant High School in Cottondale, Alabama, and was a top-10 ""athlete"" recruit nationally but decided to eschew the Tide to play for in-state rival Auburn. His career started with a bang, earning SEC All-Freshman Team honors in his first year after starting nine of 13 games played. He led the conference with 20.5 yards per catch that season (26 receptions, 534 yards) and tied for his squad's lead with five receiving touchdowns.

He covered 760 yards and scored four times (both team highs) on 47 receptions (16.2 per) in 11 starts in 2020, catching his third career game-winning score against Ole Miss to add to his big catches against Texas A&M in 2018 and Oregon in the 2019 season opener. -- by Chad Reuter",5.84,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/seth-williams/32005749-4c52-1263-5c33-d4d14ef18b01
Avery Williams,"Williams earned All-Mountain West Conference honors in all four of his playing seasons in Boise. In 2017, he was a second-team all-conference return specialist, leading the league in punt-return average (27-303-11.2, two TDs) while also excelling on kick returns (15-371-24.7). He also started 10 of 14 games played at cornerback (45 tackles, two interceptions, 8 pass breakups). Williams was an honorable mention all-conference defender in 2018 (49 tackles, two interceptions, 9 pass breakups, three forced fumbles) while again returning punts (18-126-7.0; also 2-78-39.0, one TD on kick returns). In 2019, league coaches voted him to their first team as a punt returner (22-290-13.2, two TDs; also 2-60-30.0 on kick returns) and an honorable mention pick as a 14-game starter on defense (39 tackles, 1.5 for loss, four pass breakups). Williams was a first-team pick as a cornerback (19 tackles, two for loss, one pass breakup in seven games, six starts), kick returner and punt returner, while also serving as a senior team captain. The Associated Press named him a third-team All-American as an all-purpose player because he led the FBS in combined return yardage (19-533-28.1 kick returns, 15-229-15.3 punt returns), topped the country with two punt return touchdowns and tied for the national lead with two kick return touchdowns. He also tied for fifth in the FBS with two blocked kicks. -- by Chad Reuter",5.84,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/avery-williams/32005749-4c14-5932-c5ba-f059c1055afd
Kenny Yeboah,"Yeboah (pronounced ya-BOW-ah) went from all-state pick at Allentown's Parkland Senior High School to suiting up for home-state Temple.

Yeboah started twice in 2018, making 13 receptions for 154 yards (11.8 average) and a TD in 13 games. He scored five times on 19 receptions as a redshirt junior for the Owls (covering 233 yards) in 11 games with eight starts. Yeboah entered the transfer portal before the team's bowl game, however, and decided to make his way to Oxford to complete his collegiate career. He had initially planned on joining his old Temple head coach, Matt Rhule, at Baylor. Once Rhule was hired by the Carolina Panthers, Yeboah reconsidered his commitment and joined the Rebels. He jumped onto the radars of NFL scouts early on in 2020, averaging a healthy 19.4 yards per reception (27 catches for 524 yards) while scoring six times in eight starts before opting out to prepare for the NFL draft.

Jalen Camp,"Camp hopes to be the next Georgia Tech receiver to make it in the NFL, following Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas and Darren Waller. His production was limited in former head coach Paul Johnson's triple-option offense in 2016 (no statistics in 11 games), 2017 (1-49 in 11 games), and 2018 (11-186-16.9). The passing game came to Atlanta for 2019 but Camp was limited in four starts (7-134-19.1, one TD) as he redshirted to have surgery on a nagging injury in the preseason. Healthy enough as a senior, Camp led the Yellow Jackets with 27 receptions, 369 receiving yards (13.7 per), and four touchdowns in 10 games (nine starts). -- by Chad Reuter",5.83,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-camp/32004341-4d12-4778-9047-56d3a484e7d7
Jaelon Darden,"Darden was an all-district quarterback in the Houston area at Eisenhower High School, but from Day 1 at North Texas, his future at receiver was clear. He played in all 14 games as a backup during his true freshman campaign (32-281-8.8, three TD) while also contributing as a returner (16-295-18.4 on kickoffs; 10-119-11.9, one TD on punts). Darden mostly focused on offense in 2018 (48-575-12.0, four TDs receiving; 5-62-12.4 punt returns). He became the team's leading receiver as a junior (76-736-9.7, 12 TD; 16-108-6.8 punt returns), attaining first-team All-Conference USA accolades as a 12-game starter. Darden's game took a leap forward in 2020. He ranked second in the FBS with 19 receiving touchdowns, third with 132.2 receiving yards a game (1,190 total in nine starts), and seventh with 8.2 receptions per game (74, 16.1 per). The Associated Press voted him a second-team All-American and league coaches named him the C-USA Most Valuable Player and a first-team all-conference receiver.

He played in 21 games as a reserve over three years for the Bruins (65 rushes, 277 yards, 4.3 average, one touchdown; 12 receptions, 108 yards, 9.0 average), but redshirted in 2018 after two games in order to find a new opportunity elsewhere. SMU signed him as a graduate transfer in 2019, moving him to cornerback. He started all 13 games for the Mustangs that year, leading the team with 12 pass breakups (also making 49 tackles, 2.5 for loss). Stephens again led the squad with 10 pass breakups as a senior, intercepting his first collegiate pass and stopping 43 ball-carriers in 10 starts. He was named a team captain and awarded the team's No. 23 jersey in 2020, which honors Jerry LeVias, the first Black athlete to receive a football scholarship in the now-defunct Southwest Conference. LeVias also played in the AFL with the Houston Oilers and in the NFL with the Oilers and San Diego Chargers. -- by Chad Reuter",5.83,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-stephens/32005354-4535-6284-a974-7b8553e53cd0

The former four-star recruit from New Jersey split his 11 starts between the left (four) and right (seven) tackle spots in 2018, playing in all 13 games that season. Fries stayed at right tackle for all 13 games as a redshirt junior, and Big Ten coaches voted him honorable mention all-conference for his play there.

Jamie Newman,"Newman signed with Wake Forest as a three-star prospect, redshirting as a true freshman. Newman played in three games as a reserve in 2017 (2 of 4 for eight yards, one INT). Though he missed the first three games of the 2018 season with an injury, Newman stepped in for starter Sam Hartman to lead a comeback win over North Carolina State in early November, then led the team to a 3-1 record as a starter to end the year (84-141-59.6, 1,083 yards, nine TDs, four INTs passing; 64-247-3.9, four TDs rushing in six games overall).

Newsome had some issues catching passes during spring 2019 practice, so he got contact lenses. The improved sight helped him become one of then-freshman quarterback Sam Howell's favorite targets in 2019, garnering second-team All-ACC honors with a team-high 72 receptions for 1,108 yards (15.4 per) and 10 touchdowns in 12 starts. He scored twice against Temple in the team's Military Bowl victory. Newsome was an honorable mention all-conference pick in 2020 (54 receptions, 684 yards, 12.7 average, six touchdowns; two carries, 21 yards, one touchdown; 17 punt returns, 168 yards, 9.9 average), starting all 12 games. -- by Chad Reuter",5.8,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dazz-newsome/32004e45-5755-6353-3b58-0786107557cf

He planned to play as a true freshman in 2016 but wound up redshirting after four games (5-27-5.4 receiving) due to injury. Stoner was a major contributor on offense and special teams the following two seasons, starting six of 12 games played in 2017 (44-576-13.1, six TDs receiving; 1-23-23.0 kick return; 9-55-6.1 punt returns) and seven of 12 games in 2018 (48-603-12.6, two TDs receiving; 11-62-5.6 punt returns).

Ian Book,"Book planned to sign with Boise State as a Sacramento Bee All-Metro selection from Oak Ridge High School in California. But when head coach Mike Sanford left to become the offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, the quarterback switched his commitment to play for Mike Leach at Washington State. However, Book ultimately joined Sanford in South Bend instead (though the coach was only in town for one year before taking the head coaching job at Western Kentucky). Book made a name for himself in Notre Dame lore by coming off the bench to lead the Irish to a win over LSU in the Citrus Bowl his redshirt freshman season. He played in 10 games with one start that season (46-of-75, 61.3 completion percentage, 456 yards, four touchdowns, four interceptions passing; 37 carries, 207 yards, 5.6 yards per carry).

Zach Davidson,"Davidson has excelled in one of the most unusual double-duty roles in college football the past three seasons. The Webb City, Missouri, native has been the Mules' punter since his redshirt freshman season, when he averaged 44.3 yards per kick. He averaged 42.8 yards per punt as a sophomore and 40.3 as a junior, though he forced a career-high 16 fair catches in 2019. NFL scouts are more interested in his performance at tight end as a junior, however, because he was a first-team Associated Press Division II All-American and first-team All-Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association selection. Davidson ranked seventh in D2 by averaging 22.4 yards per reception and tied for seventh with 15 touchdowns among his 40 receptions (894 yards) in 13 games (12 starts).

He was also a track star in high school, winning state titles in the 300-meter hurdles as a freshman (also finished second in the 110-meter event) and sophomore. Grimes' time in Columbus was short, however, as he left after a redshirt season where he played in two games as a reserve (three receptions, 20 yards, 6.7 average).

He still started seven of 11 games played that year (204-300-68.0, 2,454 yards, 13 TDs, five INTs passing; 97-252-2.6, seven TDs rushing), though, because Penix was injured.

Brendon White,"White was a four-star recruit out of Olentangy Liberty High School in Ohio who played quarterback as a senior after earning all-state honors at defensive back his junior year. Coming out of high school, he chose to attend Ohio State. Seeing how he's the son of former all-conference Buckeyes defensive back William White, who played in the NFL for 11 seasons, it was no surprise when Brendon signed to play for Urban Meyer. He played in just five games as a reserve defensive back and receiver during his true freshman year, making one tackle. White stuck on defense as a sophomore (46 tackles, four for loss, two pass breakups and one interception in 13 appearances), starting the final five contests -- including the Rose Bowl, where he earned the Defensive MVP Award with eight tackles, two for loss, and an interception on a two-point conversion.

He started all 12 games as a junior, garnering third-team all-conference notice (89 tackles, six for loss, one interception, four pass breakups, two forced fumbles). Fisher capped his career at NU by winning Big Ten Linebacker of the Year and first-team all-conference honors in 2020.

Williams opted out of the 2020 season after starting four games (51-196-3.8, two TDs rushing; 6-31-5.2 receiving; 7-197-28.1, one TD kick returns), citing the need to help his mother, who was battling health issues. Williams was arrested and charged with domestic battery in December 2018 after a female Kansas student told police that he punched her in the stomach and grabbed her by the throat. Williams later reached a diversion agreement in the case and served a suspension in the 2019 season opener. -- by Chad Reuter",5.52,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/pooka-williams-jr/32005749-4c57-7955-f764-b9b760ac2bf0
Mustafa Johnson,"Mustafa (pronounced moo-stoff-uh) Johnson grew up in the Denver metro area and then moved to California prior to his freshman year in high school, eventually becoming a two-time Central California Conference Defensive Player of the Year for Turlock High School. After one season at Modesto Junior College, he went back to his home state to play for the Buffaloes. As a sophomore, Johnson earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors from the coaches -- and was UC's Co-Defensive Player of the Year -- after leading his squad with 18 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks among his 73 tackles in 12 starts. His junior year was truncated to nine starts (34 tackles, 4.5 sacks), however, due to an ankle injury.

Calvin Ashley,"Ashley was a five-star recruit for Gus Malzahn's 2017 Auburn recruiting class out of St. John's College High School in the Washington D.C. area, where he played as a senior after moving up from Orlando. He decided after two seasons on the Plains (redshirting in 2017, and then starting one of five appearances at right tackle in 2018) that he wanted to be closer to home. He transferred to Florida Atlantic at first, then determining that Boca Raton was not close enough to his wife and young son in Tallahassee. Ashley, therefore, signed with Florida A&M and suited up for seven starts at right tackle for the Rattlers in 2019. The school did not play in the fall of 2020 due to COVID-19. -- by Chad Reuter",5.5,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/calvin-ashley/32004153-4854-7728-2233-91aaaeeada8b

John Bates,"Most college tight ends are not former 110-meter hurdle and javelin state champions in high school (Bates finished in the top five in the triple and long jumps at Oregon's state meet in 2014, as well). A two-time all-state pick in football at Lebanon High School, as well, Bates was a three-star prospect when he signed with the Broncos. He started two of 14 games played as a redshirt freshman in 2017 (3 catches, 34 yards, 11.3 yards per catch) and then eight of 13 games the following season (10 catches, 155 yards, 15.5 yards per catch, one TD). Bates became a larger part of the Broncos' offense his junior year (22 catches, 273 yards, 12.4 yards per catch, one TD) and garnered honorable mention All-Mountain West Conference notice -- an honor he repeated in 2020, despite missing time with a hamstring injury (12 catches, 117 yards, 9.8 yards per catch in five games, with four starts).

He played in all 14 games as a reserve for the Hokies (six tackles), but then ran afoul of the law for conspiracy to sell and possession of marijuana in 2017. Beckett was suspended indefinitely, although the charges were dropped after he complied with a court order and performed 100 hours of community service. Beckett redshirted the 2018 season at Marshall as a transfer student and then came on strong as a junior, garnering first-team All-Conference USA accolades after leading the league with 121 tackles (seven for loss with two sacks), breaking up four passes and forcing two fumbles. He was the C-USA Defensive Player of the Year and first-team all-conference in 2020, starting nine games and again leading his defense with 90 tackles (7.5 for loss with 2.5 sacks) while also forcing two fumbles and recovering four.

Rakeem Boyd,"Boyd was a four-star recruit after running for 6,436 yards and scoring 80 times during his high school career. He originally signed with Texas A&M, but academic issues forced him to redshirt in 2016 and transfer to Independence Community College (1,211 yards, 14 TDs rushing in 2017) to get his grades in order. Boyd's next stop was Fayetteville. He led the Razorbacks in rushing as a sophomore (123-734-6.0, two TDs) and junior (184-1,133-6.2, eight TDs) while also contributing as a receiver (23-165-7.2 in 2018; 19-160-8.4 in 2019).

Buechele injured his shoulder his sophomore campaign (137-for-213, 64.3 comp%, 1,405 yards, seven TDs, four INTs; 62-99-1.6, two TDs rushing), starting seven of nine games but eventually losing his job to Sam Ehlinger. After playing in just two games in 2018 (30-for-44, 68.2 comp%, 273 yards, two TDs, one INT), he decided to transfer to SMU as a graduate student to play for Mustangs head coach Sonny Dykes, who recruited Buechele when he was coaching at Cal.

Crosswell started all 13 games as a sophomore in 2019 (50 tackles, two interceptions, 10 pass breakups, three forced fumbles).

His game took a big step forward in 2019, as he garnered second-team Associated Press All-American and second-team All-Pac-12 honors by leading the FBS with 22.5 tackles for loss and tying for third in the country with 14 sacks (among 62 total tackles) while also breaking up three passes and forcing two fumbles in 12 games (11 starts). Rashed had two tackles for loss (and no sacks) in seven starts in 2020 (23 tackles in total) with opposing offenses focusing their attack in his direction. Pac-12 coaches still voted him an honorable mention all-conference selection, though.

Keith Taylor,"Taylor missed most of his junior season at Long Beach's Servite High School, but still managed to rate as one of the top 150 recruits in the country. Washington snapped him up from Southern California, and he played in 12 games as a reserve in 2017 (eight tackles, one pass breakup). Taylor started twice as a sophomore (15 tackles, 1.5 for loss, three pass breakups in 14 contests) before moving into the lineup full-time in his junior campaign (59 tackles, two for loss, five pass breakups in 13 games). He started all four of Washington's games in 2020, making nine stops and breaking up one pass.

Connor Wedington,"Wedington made an instant impact for the Cardinal as a true freshman, catching 31 passes for 243 yards (7.8 per) as a reserve while also contributing as a rusher (3-57-19.0) and on special teams (2-6-3.0 punt returns) in 13 games as a reserve. He started one of four appearances in 2019 (9-65-7.2 receiving; 2-18-9.0 punt returns), suffering an injury in the opener that kept him out of nine game. The Pac-12 saw a healthy Wedington in 2019, and he was voted honorable mention all-conference and Stanford's Most Outstanding Special Teams Player for his efforts as a kick returner (21-590-28.1). He also started 10 of 11 appearances at receiver, grabbing 51 balls for 506 yards (9.9 per) and a score. Wedington started three games as a team captain in 2020 (15-157-10.5 receiving; 4-95-23.8 kick returns) before sitting out the rest of the year with another injury. -- by Chad Reuter",5.5,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/connor-wedington/32005745-4462-9229-4a3d-e3f35518af0f
Matt Bushman,"Bushman's aiming for a future in the professional ranks, though he already married into the NFL family. His wife, Emily, is former pro tight end Chad Lewis' daughter. Bushman was an honorable mention Parade High School All-American in 2013 and then served a church mission in Santiago, Chile, before joining the Cougars' football (and baseball) squad. He was the team's leading receiver in 2017 (49-520-10.6, three TDs), playing in all 13 games with eight starts. Bushman was BYU's top receiver in 2018, as well, averaging a healthy 17.6 yards per reception (29-511, two TDs) while again starting eight of 13 games played. He led the team with 688 receiving yards as a junior, catching 47 passes and averaging 14.6 yards per reception with a team-high four scores in 13 games (11 starts). Bushman decided to return to school for 2020 instead of going to the NFL, but a ruptured Achilles ended his season before it began. -- by Chad Reuter",5.49,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-bushman/32004255-5334-8229-ae00-6d2b2a980622
Marlon Character,"Character was never a full-time starter with the Cardinals, but displayed playmaking ability. He started six of 11 games in 2020, making 37 tackles (three for loss), intercepting one pass and breaking up six others. Character started four of 12 games in 2018 (30 tackles, one pass breakup) and played in 11 games as a reserve (16 tackles) in his first year at Louisville. The Atlanta native matriculated to Auburn in 2016, redshirting that fall but transferring after reportedly having an argument with a teammate.

Jon Dietzen,"Dietzen started 12 games at left tackle for the Badgers in 2018, but decided to retire from football before the following season due to various injuries. After sitting out that season, he changed his mind, stepping into the starting lineup again in 2020 for seven games (one at right guard, one at left tackle, five at right guard). The Wisconsin product received the Joe Thomas Award as the state's top offensive lineman his senior year at Seymour High School. He earned eight starts at left guard in 10 appearances in 2016, missing some time due to injury. Dietzen started 12 of 13 games played at left guard as a sophomore before shifting to tackle. -- by Chad Reuter",5.49,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jon-dietzen/32004449-4577-9495-edca-c24fea5b5e2e

He stepped into a starting job as a redshirt freshman, beginning seven of eight games played at left guard before suffering a season-ending knee injury. Heggie fought through injuries in 2018, playing in nine contests as a reserve guard. He started 12 games the following season, eight at left guard and four at right guard. The departure of Nick Buchanan opened up the center spot for 2020, and Heggie started all 12 games in the pivot.

Isaiah Kaufusi,"Kaufusi (pronounced kah-FOO-see) is yet another member of a family present in college and pro football over the past three decades. His father, Jeff, played at Utah, while his brother, Jackson, plays at BYU, joining cousins Bronson, Corbin and Devin as Cougars -- and that's just a sample of the family's football history. Isaiah's game progressed over the past five years, culminating in a senior season where he led the squad with 83 tackles (4.5 for loss with four sacks in 12 games/nine starts), while ranking third in the FBS with three fumble recoveries and sixth with three forced fumbles. Kaufusi also intercepted a pass, which he returned for a score. He started 10 of 13 appearances in 2019 (60 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two interceptions, tied for team lead with five pass breakups) after starting six of 11 contests as a redshirt sophomore (50 tackles, six for loss, tied for team lead with two interceptions, adding four pass breakups). In 2017, Kaufusi played in 11 games as a reserve, posting 11 tackles. He and his wife, Breanna, have a son named Foster.

The Florida native and first-team all-state selection from Pinellas Park High School in the Tampa area played extensively as a true freshman, as well, starting the final 11 contests of the 2017 season (34 tackles, 4.5 for loss with two sacks in 13 total appearances) to earn Freshman All-American accolades.  -- by Chad Reuter",5.49,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordon-scott/32005343-4f40-9166-f835-b0f2af7be1c7
Rico Bussey,"Bussey was offered scholarships by the three Division I service academies coming out of Eisenhower High School. His father has spent 20-plus years in the Army, though, and Bussey has said that option wasn't a fit for him. North Texas coaches gave him a chance to play as a true freshman (eight receptions, 97 yards, 12.1 average, one touchdown in six games, one start) and then really used his talents in 2017 despite not starting him (47-677-14.4, seven touchdowns in 13 games). Bussey became all-conference quarterback Mason Fine's favorite target in 2018 (68 receptions, 1,017 yards, 15.0 average), which allowed him to finish eighth in the FBS with 12 touchdown catches. He played in just three games in 2019, however, due to a knee injury (five receptions, 150 yards, 30.0 average, one touchdown). Bussey decided to finish his collegiate career at Hawaii, where he started eight games in 2020 (31 receptions, 274 yards, 8.8 average, one touchdown). -- by Chad Reuter",5.48,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rico-bussey/32004255-5377-2405-6fba-5f1258bef2a5

Cole was one of the top defenders at the FCS level in both 2018 and 2019 and likely would have been in 2020 if COVID-19 had not halted play for most schools in the division. Alcorn also did not play in the spring of 2021 due to the pandemic. As a junior in 2019, he was named first-team All-SWAC and led the Braves to the Celebration Bowl for the second straight year (both losses to champs North Carolina A&T). He started 12 of 13 games that season (86 tackles, team-high five interceptions, one pass breakup) and seven of 13 contests in 2018 (team-high 76 tackles, 4.5 for loss, three interceptions, five pass breakups).

The second-team All-Big 12 selection started 12 games at right tackle, missing two contests and the second half of the Big 12 Championship Game due to injury. Ealy was a second-team all-conference pick again in 2020 as he started all 11 games, the opener at left tackle and the remaining 10 contests on the right side.

Mark Gilbert,"Gilbert showed great promise early in his career with the Blue Devils. He enrolled a semester early after earning all-state honors in football his senior year at Terry Sanford High School. (He was also named the Cape Fear area Basketball Player of the Year by the Fayetteville Observer as a junior.) Duke coaches put the top-40 national cornerback prospect in the starting lineup his true freshman season (18 tackles, two for loss, two pass breakups in 12 appearances). Gilbert became a first-team All-ACC selection as a sophomore, tying for third in the FBS with six interceptions and ranking eighth with 15 pass breakups. The 21 passes defensed was a school record, and he also posted 35 tackles (three for loss) in 13 starts. However, he suffered a severe left hip dislocation in the second game of 2018 (he finished with four tackles in two starts) and missed the rest of that season along with the 2019 campaign as he underwent multiple surgeries. He returned to start the first two games of the 2020 season (eight tackle, one interception), but had to go back under the knife to remove loose bone fragments in his right foot. After the surgery, he opted out of the rest of the year due to COVID-19 and to prepare for the NFL draft. Gilbert is the nephew of former NFL defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, who was the No. 3 overall pick in 1992 and played in the league for 11 years. He is also related to former NFL star cornerback Darrelle Revis, who made seven Pro Bowls in 10 NFL seasons and won a Super Bowl with New England. -- by Chad Reuter",5.48,2021,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mark-gilbert/32004749-4c11-7153-6787-8da3d8fffcf6

He played behind Adrian Killins but still managed 1,182 yards and 10 touchdowns on just 133 carries (8.9 per) in 13 contests (also 8-116-14.5, one TD receiving). A knee injury derailed his junior year a bit, though he started six of 10 games played (98-529-5.4, seven TDs rushing; 9-64-7.1 receiving).

Woods redshirted in 2017, but came on the following year to win the Great Lakes Valley Conference Special Teams Player of the Year award after tying for the Division II lead with three kickoff returns for touchdowns. Woods started all 11 games on defense that year, as well (43 tackles, two sacks, 10 pass breakups). He started the first four games of the 2019 season before tearing his ACL (17 tackles, one interception, eight pass breakups; 2-115-57.5, one TD on kick returns).

Justin Hilliard,"Hilliard was a five-star prospect, 2014 Division I State Player of the Year and High School Dick Butkus Award finalist at St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati. Unfortunately, he had to redshirt the 2015 season with a torn biceps. He played in three games as a reserve the following year (four tackles) but another torn biceps ended that year. Hilliard stayed healthy for all 14 games as a backup in 2017 (14 tackles) and he tied for the team lead with six special team tackles in 2018 (20 tackles overall, one for loss in 13 games). He started three times in 12 games in 2019, posting 13 tackles, three for loss, and an interception after coming back from an Achilles injury in the spring. Hilliard was granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA due to injuries suffered early in his Buckeyes career. He took advantage of the extra year to play an integral role in the team reaching the national title game in 2020, starting four of six games played (33 tackles, five for loss).

He was a key special teams contributor in each of his first three seasons, making two tackles during his career in addition to placing snaps right on the money. Fletcher received the Patrick Mannelly Award as the nation's top long snapper in 2020, again handling all duties for the Tide's national title run.

Blake Haubeil,"Haubeil (pronounced HAW-bill) was a third-team All-Big Ten selection in 2019 after converting 13-of-15 field goal tries (86.7 percent), including his final 10 attempts, and converting all 85 extra point tries (which ranked second in the FBS). His senior season was not as productive (24-of-24 XP, 5-of-7 field goals, 71.4 percent) because he missed two-plus games with a groin injury and the national title game because of a positive COVID-19 test. Haubeil was a USA Today First-Team All-American as a senior at Canisius High School in Buffalo, then became the Buckeyes' kickoff specialist as a true freshman. He continued those duties over four seasons (83 touchbacks on 320 kicks) while also making 11 tackles in coverage -- a big number for a college kicker. Haubeil took over placement kicks midway through his sophomore year (37-of-37 XP, 10-of-13 field goals, 76.9 percent).

Trey McBride,"McBride excelled in three sports at Fort Morgan High School, earning All-Colorado honors in football, setting the school record for points scored in basketball as well as most home runs and runs batted in for the baseball squad.

McBride was a first-team All-Mountain West Conference pick as a sophomore (45-560-12.4, four TDs in 12 games, 11 starts) and a second-team selection the following season (team-high 22-330-14.0, four TDs in four starts). He considered transferring before the Mountain West decided to play a shortened fall season due to COVID-19 concerns.

Leal played well enough in the fall, however, to be named the team's Top Defensive Newcomer (38 tackles, 5.5 for loss with two sacks, in 13 games) after taking over as a starter for seven games when Micheal Clemons went down to injury. He started all 10 games for the Aggies in 2020 (37 tackles, seven for loss with 2.5 sacks, one interception, three pass breakups) and was named to the Associated Press All-Bowl Team with his seven tackles, one for loss, in the Orange Bowl win over North Carolina.

Troy Andersen,"Andersen is one of the more versatile performers in college football in recent memory. He showed skills on offense and defense during his career at Beaverhead County High School in Montana, starring at safety and quarterback as well as twice winning state titles in the 100- and 200-meter dashes. Bobcats coaches played Andersen in 11 games his true freshman season, starting him at running back in the opener (90-515-5.7, five TDs rushing on the season; 7-45-6.5, one TD receiving) and also once at linebacker (nine tackles, one sack) later in the season.

In three of his 11 starts, Andersen was on the field with the No. 1 offense, as well as on defense. He suffered a lower-body injury in November, missing the final four games of the year. Doctors thought his injury would heal without surgery, but it did not, so he underwent surgery in early 2020 and would have missed the fall season, had the school played. Andersen was good to go for 2021, grabbing first-team Associated Press FCS All-American and Big Sky Conference Defensive Player of the Year honors by ranking second in the FCS with 147 tackles (14 for loss, with two sacks), intercepting two passes (one returned for a score) and breaking up seven in 15 starts for the national runners-up.

Aaron Hansford,"Hansford, a four-star recruit and first-team USA Today District of Columbia selection from St. John's College High School, considered committing to UCLA because of offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone. When Mazzone moved on to A&M to work with head coach Kevin Sumlin, Hansford took his game to College Station. He redshirted in 2016 after playing two games as a reserve tight end; he then played in seven games on offense the following season (3-39-13.0 receiving). An injury sidelined him in 2018 and Jimbo Fisher's coaches decided to move Hansford to linebacker. He started one of 13 appearances in 2019 (15 tackles, three for loss with two sacks, two pass breakups) and showed enough promise that he moved into a larger role when Anthony Hines opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19.

The Fontana, California product (he shares a hometown with former BYU and current NFL RB Jamaal Williams) walked on at BYU because of a lack of scholarship offers. He redshirted in 2018, playing in four games as a reserve (9-49-5.4, 2-57-28.5 kick returns). Allgeier saw action at running back (17-119-7.0 rushing; 3-67-22.3, one TD receiving), linebacker (26 tackles, one forced fumble) and kick returner (2-40.0) in 13 games as a reserve in 2019. Allgeier had a profane anti-cancer theme written on his left shoe vs. Navy in 2020 despite BYU's school code outlawing that language.

Allen missed five games in 2018 with a groin injury, resulting in just one start in eight appearances on the year (8-84-10.5). The former three-star prospect only started five of 13 games played as a junior but was again a second-team all-conference selection with 17 receptions for 167 yards (9.8 per rec.) and two scores.

Kendrick was a first-team all-league selection as a junior, leading the Tigers with six pass breakups in nine games (also 17 tackles, one interception, eight starts).

Not surprisingly, Bell got on the field immediately for the Boilermakers, starting nine of 12 games played and tying for 10th nationally with 7.2 receptions per game (86-1,035-12.0, seven TDs receiving; 3-12-4.0, one TD rushing in 12 games, nine starts) to earn Freshman All-American, Big Ten Freshman of the Year and honorable mention all-conference accolades.

As a sophomore, Johnson looked like the next outstanding A&M pass rusher while posting 32 tackles, 6.5 for loss with four sacks in 12 games (10 starts). And while Johnson didn‚Äôt exactly explode on the scene in 2020, he still provided a strong presence in the backfield when starter Micheal Clemons was lost to injury (23 tackles, six for loss with four sacks in 10 games, including five starts). He had a career-best nine tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks among his 31 total tackles in 2021, starting nine of 12 games played.

Tre Turner,"William Lee Turner III plays receiver, like his father, but he signed with Tech instead of his dad's alma mater, North Carolina State. Turner's brother, P.J. Hairston, played basketball at North Carolina and was a first-round pick for the Charlotte Hornets. Turner also received multiple basketball scholarship offers after his career at Northwest Guilford High School in Greensboro, N.C., but he turned his sights to the gridiron. As a true freshman in 2018, he started five of 12 appearances and led the Hokies by averaging 20.6 yards per reception (26-535, four TDs). Turner was Tech's top receiver in 2019 (34-553-16.3, four TDs) and also rushed 24 times for 231 yards (9.6 per) and a score in 11 starts. He had similar production in 2020 (34-529-15.6, three TDs receiving; 9-60-5.7, two TDs rushing in 10 starts) despite playing through plantar fasciitis and suffering a sports hernia late in the year.

He wore the No. 25 jersey against Miami to honor former long-time head coach Frank Beamer, who wore that number as a defensive back at Tech. Hokies coaches had to drive Turner from Blacksburg to Miami for that game, however, because he suffered from pneumomediastinum, where air gets stuck in his chest between his lungs, which prohibited him from flying. -- by Chad Reuter",5.9,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-turner/32005455-5271-6597-9b6b-86f3424b59d7

He started 11 of 13 games played, leading his squad with six receiving touchdowns (32-447-14.0) and being named to the SEC All-Freshman Team. Wydermyer topped the Aggies with 46 receptions and tied for the lead with six receiving scores in 2020, garnering second-team all-conference and John Mackey Award finalist honors. He missed 2021 spring practices after a freak off-field accident where a cut finger required surgery, but showed no ill effects by starting all 12 games in the fall. Wydermyer was named second-team All-SEC and a finalist for the John Mackey Award as the nation's top tight end after leading A&M with 515 receiving yards (40 catches, 12.9 per rec., four scores in 12 starts).

He came back strong in 2021 by starting 10 games (46-514-11.2, three TDs). As a sophomore, Ross was named honorable mention All-ACC selection after leading his squad in receptions (66-865-13.1, eight TDs) as a 14-game starter. He led Clemson in receiving yards as a true freshman without starting a game, catching 46 passes for 1,000 yards (21.7 per rec.) and nine scores in 15 games for the national champions.

In 2020, West started all four games for the Sun Devils at left guard, receiving a first-team all-conference nod from league coaches.

Cameron Dicker,"Dicker was a two-time all-state selection out of Lake Travis High School in Austin, then moved right into the starting placekicker role for the Longhorns. Big 12 coaches were impressed enough with his efforts in 2018 (18-25-72.0 FG, long 52; 51-52 XP; 52 touchbacks on 83 kickoffs) to vote him second-team all-conference. He made a big name for himself with a game-winner against Oklahoma in the 2018 Red River Rivalry. Dicker was an honorable mention All-Big 12 selection as a sophomore, converting 56 of 57 extra point tries and making 14 of 18 field goal attempts. The 2020 second-team all-conference selection was strong on kicks (50-51-98.0 XP; 15-21-71.4 FG, long of 53, one blocked) and kickoffs (61 touchbacks on 73 kicks).

Jeffrey Gunter,"Gunter signed with Coastal Carolina out of Riverside High School in Durham, N.C., starting in one game out of 12 appearances (26 tackles, 3.5 for loss) as a true freshman in 2017. He was a first-team All-Sun Belt Conference pick in 2018, as well as the team's Defensive Player of the Year after leading the squad with 14 tackles for loss with five sacks among 49 total tackles in 12 starts. Gunter transferred to N.C. State after the season, where he sat out for 2019 per NCAA rules. He originally committed to Syracuse but had a change of heart when N.C. State offered him a scholarship because it was closer to his family in Durham. NCSU's defensive line coach left for Florida Atlantic after the 2019 season, however, and Gunter decided to return to Coastal. The NCAA granted a waiver allowing him to play immediately, which turned out to be a big deal given he was named first-team All-Sun Belt Conference and led the FBS with six forced fumbles in 12 starts in 2020 (along with 58 tackles, 12.5 for loss and 6.5 sacks). Gunter received second-team all-conference accolades in 2021 for his play in 12 starts (41 tackles, 10 for loss with 6.5 sacks, two forced fumbles). -- by Chad Reuter",5.88,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeffrey-gunter/32004755-4e66-6191-8e0e-ccda0e5629ed

Hansen only started nine games in 2019 (72 tackles, 7.5 for loss with 3.5 sacks) but managed to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten honors after forcing an FBS-high seven fumbles. He was a third-team all-conference selection in 2020, recording 68 tackles, a team-high 10 for loss with 2.5 sacks, two interceptions, two pass breakups and two forced fumbles in eight starts.

Henningsen started five of 14 games the following year (24 tackles, five for loss with four sacks, two pass breakups, three fumble recoveries). A torn biceps muscle limited him to two games in 2020 (two tackles) but he played well enough in his 2021 return (34 tackles, six for loss with 3.5 sacks in 13 starts) that Big Ten coaches voted him third-team all-conference.

Borghi was mistaken for Christian McCaffrey while touring Stanford (where McCaffrey played) during the recruiting process but chose to play for head coach Mike Leach at WSU. He was an all-purpose star in two seasons under Leach, first playing in all 13 games with two starts as a true freshman in 2018 (72-366-5.1 with eight TDs rushing; 53-374-7.1 with four TDs receiving). The next year, Borghi led the Cougars with 817 rushing yards, 11 rushing scores (127 carries, 6.4 per) and 86 receptions (597 yards, 6.9 per, five TDs) in 13 starts, receiving honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors. When Leach left for Mississippi State, Borghi jokingly tweeted that he expected to get more carries in the new offense. Unfortunately, he was forced to miss three of the team's four games in 2020 (10-95-9.5, one TD rushing; 1-7-7.0 receiving) with a back injury suffered in preseason camp. He returned in 2021 to earn honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice as WSU's top rusher (160-880-5.5, 12 TDs) while catching 16 passes for 156 yards (9.8 per) in 12 games with 11 starts. Borghi opted out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft. -- by Chad Reuter",5.6,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/max-borghi/3200424f-5241-7143-6122-139e830d7c66

Heyward played in 12 games as a reserve his true freshman season (3-10-3.3 rushing; 4-13-3.3, one TD receiving; 20-436-21.8 kick returns), but his game took off in 2019, when he was named a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as the nation's most versatile player (led team with 118-529-4.5, five TDs rushing; 32-249-7.8 receiving; 13-287-22.1 kick returns in 13 games, eight starts).

He reached 1,000 yards again in 2019 (197-1,220-6.2, eight TDs in 14 games with 10 starts) to garner second-team All-Pac-12 honors. Verdell was not as big a part of the passing game, however (14-125-8.9). Verdell's production dropped in 2020 (65-285-4.4, three TDs rushing; 9-96-10.7 receiving), as he started three times in five contests before missing the last two games of the year due to injury.

Tre Walker,"Walker transferred from Dos Palos High School to Fresno Central for his senior year, aiding his new team to a first-ever section title. He started two of 11 games played in his first year at Idaho (41 tackles, three for loss). Walker broke out in 2019, topping the Vandals with 138 tackles (nine for loss with 1.5 sacks) to garner second-team All-Big Sky Conference accolades. Walker was a first-team Associated Press FCS All-American and first-team all-conference pick in the spring 2021 season (54 tackles, 4.5 for loss with two sacks in four starts) despite missing two games due to COVID-19 protocols. He was a first-team All-Big Sky selection in the fall of 2021, leading Idaho with 105 tackles (three for loss) and breaking up three passes in 11 starts. -- by Chad Reuter",5.51,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-walker/32005741-4c33-7058-4436-8e96b4f454d8
Jeremy Webb,"Webb is a Florida product but helped Stevenson High School win an Illinois state title his senior year before signing with ASA College in New York. The brother of former LSU and NFL defensive tackle Ego Ferguson was an all-conference pick his sophomore season at ASA (four pass breakups in 10 games), then transferred to Virginia Tech. Unfortunately, Webb tore an Achilles during 2018 spring practices and then tore the other just as he was getting ready to return to the team. He redshirted that fall and played in just three games (one tackle) the following year for the Hokies. Webb went to Missouri State for a fresh start, playing in all 10 games of the 2020-21 season and leading the team with three interceptions (38 tackles, six pass breakups, nine starts). Once again changing addresses in 2021, he played in 11 games for the Jayhawks (32 tackles, three pass breakups) with starts in the final three contests. -- by Chad Reuter",5.5,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-webb/32005745-4220-5565-20b8-7b1ccc2fdc69
Russ Yeast,"Russ is the son of Craig Yeast, who was the SEC's all-time leader with 208 receptions when he left Kentucky to play nine seasons of professional football in three leagues. The younger Yeast made his own name as a four-star recruit and state Player of the Year as an all-around offensive weapon at Center Grove High School in Indiana. Louisville signed him to play defensive back and he started seven games at corner as a true freshman in 2017 (23 tackles, two pass breakups). Yeast was a reserve in 2018 (eight tackles) before moving to a starting role at safety the following year (61 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups, two forced fumbles). He started 11 games for the second straight year in 2020 (45 tackles, three pass breakups) and then transferred to Kansas State for his final year of eligibility. Yeast led the Wildcats with four interceptions and 10 pass breakups in 13 starts last season, garnering first-team All-Big 12 honors for his play. -- by Chad Reuter",5.5,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/russ-yeast/32005945-4152-5112-3001-0e8ff46b01f3
Ken Marks,"Marks was known as ""Grandpa"" on the field as a seventh-year player with the Ragin' Cajuns in 2021. The former two-star recruit redshirted in 2015 and played in one game the following year before starting once at right tackle in eight appearances in 2017. Marks moved into the starting lineup at left guard for 14 games in 2018 but then lost all but one game at that position to a season-ending injury in 2019. He returned to garner third-team All-Sun Belt Conference honors, starting 11 times at left guard again in 2020, then shifted to left tackle for 2021, where he played in all 14 games. -- by Chad Reuter ",5.49,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ken-marks/32004d41-5225-4454-a6b4-9dbaadebc8f1
Devin Wynn,"Wynn was coached by former Georgia and NFL running back Robert Edwards at Greene County High School in Georgia, earning first-team all-state honors with 2,343 rushing yards and 34 touchdowns. Signing with Furman, Wynn started the final five games of his true freshman season and led the Paladins with 722 rushing yards and six scores (6.4 per; also 9-130-14.4, one TD receiving; 4-74-18.5 kick returns in 10 appearances). He was a second-team All-SoCon selection in 2019 (179-1,182-6.6, 14 TDs rushing; 13-141-10.9, two TDs receiving; 4-71-17.8 kick returns in 13 games, 12 starts) and the spring of 2021 (107-511-4.8, five TDs rushing; 7-72-10.3 receiving in seven starts). Wynn's final season with the Paladins was hampered by injury, however (104-492-4.7, six TDs rushing; 12-130-10.8, two TDs receiving in eight games, six starts). -- by Chad Reuter",5.46,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devin-wynn/32005759-4e12-9894-b3a7-7b895168fdc1
Inoke Moala,"Moala signed with Indiana State and then-head coach Mike Sanford despite getting some interest from FBS programs (Notre Dame, Purdue) in his home state. The two-time all-state tight end from Mishawaka played seven games on special teams as a true freshman in 2016 (five tackles). He saw more time on defense in 2017 (34 tackles, seven for loss with two sacks, two pass breakups, two forced fumbles) and started the first four games of 2018 (13 tackles, three for loss with 1.5 sacks) before suffering a season-ending injury. Moala started 11 of 12 games played in 2019 and posted 31 tackles, 12.5 for loss with 3.5 sacks, six pass breakups and two forced fumbles. The Sycamores did not play in 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns but Moala put forth a huge effort upon his return last fall, receiving first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference honors as his 39 stops included a team-high 13 tackles for loss with eight sacks. He also forced two fumbles during his 11 starts. -- by Chad Reuter",5.4,2022,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/inoke-moala/32004d4f-4136-5918-9bab-71b748bc2f30
Jalen Carter,"When assessing a player‚Äôs draft grade, we take into consideration areas like traits, toughness, explosiveness, skill level, potential for growth and positional projections. Across the board, Carter checks out in a big way. However, his maturity will need to be vetted by each team as they make their evaluations. The tape shows a defender with odd- or even-front versatility and a rare blend of first-step quickness and leverage through contact. He‚Äôs capable of finding quick wins against sloppy guard play and finishes the play once he‚Äôs in the backfield. His hand usage can be violent or subtle, but the feet are always active and searching for an opening. Based upon talent, traits and projection, Carter appears ready to step into the NFL and become a productive three-down talent with Pro Bowl potential.",7.05,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-carter/32004341-5265-6628-f264-d042e762bc39
Will Anderson Jr.,"Three-year starter for vaunted Alabama program with eye-popping production that encapsulates his potential impact. Anderson is well-built with long arms. He has the rush get-off and skill level to consistently shave edges or pry open rush paths with inside moves. Even when he‚Äôs blocked around the arc or on the diagonal, Anderson‚Äôs footwork, cornering and closing speed help him dive into the pocket. There is room for more growth with hand usage and he will need to prove he can keep racking up the sack totals outside of Nick Saban‚Äôs scheme. Anderson is suited to a 3-4 front, where he can play wider to better allow his length to overcome size deficiencies at the point of attack. His traits, athleticism and production against high-level competition are indicators of a Pro Bowl future.",7.02,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-anderson-jr/3200414e-4462-7364-511f-d68d330a6780
Bijan Robinson,"Full-menu back blending a smorgasbord of position-specific traits that allow him to affect games. Robinson is well-built with a compact lower half and pairs a low center of gravity with agile feet. There are elements of both fight and flight in his running style, but defenders can never be quite sure what they are going to get. He‚Äôs a capable inside/outside runner with unique footwork to stack moves and reset pathways, but can plow into tacklers at a moment‚Äôs notice using elite contact balance to keep the run rolling. He might need to dial back efforts to search out big runs so frequently and take what is there a little more often to keep from getting bogged down. His pass-catching talent ensures the opportunity for Robinson to see a high number of touches. He has a chance to become one of the more productive runners in the league very quickly.",6.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bijan-robinson/3200524f-4236-8260-6d5f-ae47fe2e0128
Bryce Young,"Slightly built with measurables that fall below the standard for the quarterback position, Young‚Äôs talent and face-of-the-franchise potential could force teams to focus more on his game film and less on his size. Young has had the advantage of working with a former NFL head coach (Bill O‚ÄôBrien) who understands the challenges facing a pro quarterback. He‚Äôs a full-field reader whose confident demeanor on the field oozes off the tape but never becomes unbridled cockiness. He‚Äôs thoughtful in where he wants to go with the football and keeps the turnover count low. The deep ball is nothing special and his drive velocity fails to stand out, but he has enough arm strength to make the necessary throws. Young is perfectly capable of extending plays both inside and outside the pocket, but teams will want him to stay on schedule a little more often as a pro passer. He‚Äôs poised in the face of both physical and situational pressure and possesses a full offering of intangibles that helps set him apart from some of the more physically gifted quarterbacks in this class.",6.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-young/3200594f-5512-4763-ab24-c1bd051ef0ef
Tyree Wilson,"Long-limbed defender who figures to turn into a full-blown nightmare for opponents if he continues to grow into both his frame and his game. Wilson‚Äôs combination of traits and athleticism should yield flashes of dominant play in both phases as he continues to get bigger and stronger. His length and lateral quickness are ingredients for chaos as a back-side run game disruptor. He‚Äôs capable of ranging and tackling from distance if the run flows wide. On the flip side, he‚Äôs not very instinctive as a run defender and his play demeanor could stand to be a little thornier when attacking blocks. Wilson has the physical tools to create pocket push as a power rusher early on, but the hand usage and rush plan will need tutoring for him to become a well-rounded, two-way rusher. He might not set the world on fire in Year 1, but the talent and vaulted ceiling will be easy to see soon enough.",6.77,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyree-wilson/32005749-4c80-6943-e56d-5d7ad8017cfa
Peter Skoronski,"Skoronski spent his college years manning the quarterback‚Äôs blindside at tackle, but the body type and skill set are begging for a move to guard, where he can play his best football as a pro. He‚Äôs broad across his upper and lower body, but he has short arms. Skoronski plays with a deft blend of technique, feel and power as a run blocker and is capable of thriving in any run-blocking scheme. His lack of length can be a problem against stab-and-charge bull rushers and edge speed, but a move inside would mitigate those concerns. If Skoronski can get his protection anchor sorted out, he has the run-blocking talent to become an instant starter and a top-flight guard.",6.73,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/peter-skoronski/3200534b-4f46-7199-f435-c28e7b2fe41f
Christian Gonzalez,"Explosive outside cornerback possessing a rare blend of physical and athletic traits. Gonzalez plays with fluid hips and blazing top-end speed, which should help him match against top-end targets in the future. He can rough up the release or use mirror-and-match footwork from press-man coverage and he has all the tools to become a highly capable route shadow. His technique will get away from him at times and he doesn't play with the level of instincts or ball skills that should make heavy ball production automatic. His testing numbers could send his draft stock skyrocketing, but the ingredients are already present to become a feared CB1 if he plays to his gifts.",6.7,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-gonzalez/3200474f-4e58-9051-6a8a-dad946986fed
Drew Sanders,"Unique linebacker prospect with the physical traits, athleticism and skill set to be deployed as an inside linebacker or a stand-up edge rusher. The former five-star Alabama signee transferred to Arkansas for the 2022 season and posted eye-catching production with the Razorbacks. He plays with good technique in take-ons and has plenty of pursuit range, but he‚Äôs still finding his footing with his run fits and tackle consistency. He‚Äôs a tough out for interior protection as a blitzing linebacker and has natural rush talent to hunt quarterbacks off the edge. Sanders‚Äô athletic gifts, versatility and toughness could help him become a highly impactful playmaker with Pro Bowl upside.",6.7,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/drew-sanders/32005341-4e29-0589-5c62-ee6a75833b2f
C.J. Stroud,"Two-year starter from a program with a high-octane offense known for creating high-level production opportunities for its quarterbacks. Stroud‚Äôs accuracy stands out on tape. He‚Äôs able to lead receivers with good placement and make on-frame throws to targets on all areas of the field. The question now is how quickly he will acclimate outside of the Ohio State scheme. Stroud didn‚Äôt often attack defenses with his legs, but if he can become a more willing runner, he will be able to extend drives rather than feeling forced into more challenging decision-making situations. NFL teams will have to balance what they saw on tape from Stroud during the 2022 regular season against his great College Football Playoff semifinal performance, when he shined versus Georgia‚Äôs impressive collection pro prospects. If he did it once he can do it again, and grading the flashes for Stroud might make the most sense.",6.7,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c-j-stroud/32005354-5270-2090-cc17-67cd6da43535
Jalin Hyatt,"Long, slender wideout with deep speed that could force defensive coordinators to alter coverage considerations. Hyatt‚Äôs gliding gait disguises explosive acceleration that can lead to easy separation on deep throws. However, he does display inconsistency on contested catches comes. Hyatt is ordinary getting in and out of intermediate breaks and might be best with a limited route tree full of slants, crossers and a series of field-stretching patterns. Hyatt is an instantly credible WR2 with the ability to make a huge impact, but production could be erratic due to the limitations of his game.",6.5,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalin-hyatt/32004859-4142-0916-68d0-ff3c547de346
Brian Branch,"Plug-and-play defensive back with every ingredient necessary to become a high-performing starter early in his career. Branch has primarily handled nickel coverage at Alabama but has the range and instincts for single-high or split safety looks. He‚Äôs quick, fast and strong with the ability to match up with shifty slots, bigger possession receivers and pass-catching tight ends. He‚Äôs urgent and has a mind for the game. He takes playmaking angles into the throwing lane but does have a tendency to play it a little safe from off-man coverage. There are areas where he can improve but no real weaknesses, which could make him one of the safest picks in the draft.",6.49,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brian-branch/32004252-4149-1198-dc01-dafbfa415bff
Luke Musgrave,"Between the abbreviated 2020 season and an injury-shortened 2022 campaign, Musgrave‚Äôs snaps have been somewhat limited, but it‚Äôs easy to like what he‚Äôs put on tape. His route running harkens back to his slalom days with nimble feet and smooth hips helping to generate rhythm and separation in and out of breaks. He needs a little more bulk for combat in the trenches, but he offers what evaluators are looking for in technique, strain and demeanor. Musgrave has starter potential and should gain a coveted slot on draft boards from teams looking to add versatility to their 12 personnel (two tight ends) packages.",6.49,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/luke-musgrave/32004d55-5309-7324-5085-b59d93f240ce
Dalton Kincaid,"Move tight end whose premium talent as a pass-catcher will be the primary focus for evaluators. Kincaid is a fluid route runner with the athleticism and play speed to create mismatches against lesser coverage. Impeccable ball skills and sticky hands allow him to tilt 50/50 contested throws in his favor. He lacks the play strength and technique to work in-line, but can handle some positional blocking in space from time to time. Kincaid can manage a more extended route tree, allowing calculating play-callers to open up the entire field and stress coverages. He will need to acclimate to a more physical/athletic brand of coverage, but should blossom into a weapon.",6.48,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dalton-kincaid/32004b49-4e06-9130-e563-7edd228031c8
Josh Downs,"Free-flowing athlete with dynamic footwork and an instinctive feel for how to elude opponents. Downs posted off-the-charts production over the last two seasons as an undersized slot with an oversized will. His confidence jumps off the tape and he has proven himself to be better at catching through contact than you might expect. While his route running is effective and fun to watch, coaches will need him to become more disciplined and efficient in order to maintain the timing of play designs. Downs might not have prototypical size, but he‚Äôs well-positioned to keep stacking catches and making plays as a starting NFL slot receiver.",6.44,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-downs/3200444f-5768-6145-dd60-3fbae406310a
Zay Flowers,"Slot target who plays with unbridled energy and immense confidence. Flowers is slightly built but can side-step press and fly into action with above-average acceleration and an attacking demeanor. Flowers has a tendency to rush his routes, but his ability to play with speed and move with athleticism makes him hard to read for defenders. His ball skills will shine brightly at times, but frustrating drops come with the package. Flowers has the skill set to become a valuable playmaker as a pro.",6.46,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zay-flowers/3200464c-4f57-7002-1160-832e9618f0fd
Broderick Jones,"Ultra-athletic tackle prospect with the size, length and potential to develop into a plus starter on the left side. Jones‚Äô frame and technique both are in the developmental phase. His entry into block fits can be a little disjointed. He needs to improve his punch accuracy and timing to make the most of his length in pass protection. Jones is very talented at working into space and landing a block to help spring the running game. He has the nimble feet to mirror or recover against the rush. Jones isn‚Äôt a finished product, but the physical and athletic gifts allow for a projection as a good, long-time starter.",6.44,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/broderick-jones/32004a4f-4e11-9592-d375-419b0d77efde
Michael Mayer,"Big combination tight end with the demeanor for run blocking and the size for tough, chain-moving catches underneath. Mayer will come into the league with better blocking technique than most tight ends in this year‚Äôs draft. He‚Äôs built for in-line duty and was an extension of the Notre Dame offensive line at times. His feet are a little heavy getting into and through his routes, but he has the hand strength and contact balance to win heavily contested catches on the first two levels. Mayer might need to polish his route running to become a high-volume target, but he‚Äôs a safe pick and will be a good pro who can become a plus player as a run blocker and pass catcher.",6.44,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-mayer/32004d41-5933-0676-2b57-0928ab0ea95b
Jaxon Smith-Njigba,"Smith-Njigba is a possession slot receiver who lacks the shake to separate underneath and the speed to run past defenses. He‚Äôs tough in the middle of the defense and has proven he can make catches in congestion. Smith-Njigba will need to fine-tune his route running to give himself his best chance to succeed at the next level. It is impossible to ignore his monster finish to the 2021 season, and he has starting slot potential, but the speed concerns coupled with an injury-plagued 2022 season threaten to negatively impact his draft stock.",6.43,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaxon-smith-njigba/3200534d-4982-9636-a18c-5da6fbdaa80c
Keion White,"Athletic big man offering scheme versatility and projectable upside. White has good short-area quickness as well as speed in space. He lacks consistent early phase technique to control the rep, but his recovery talent, hustle and athletic traits put him in position to get in on the action. His pass rush is predictable and lacks focus, but he‚Äôs bendy and could take a big leap forward in this department provided the coaching catches up with the physical gifts. He‚Äôs still in the developmental phase, but his physical/athletic profile gives him a chance to become a plus starter as a 4-3 or 3-4 defensive end.",6.43,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keion-white/32005748-4931-5646-3479-7fead8c7f5a8
Devon Witherspoon,"Witherspoon is a fun watch but requires evaluators to carefully consider his strengths and weaknesses relative to scheme. He plays with anticipation, route feel and a consistent sense of urgency to prevent catches, as displayed by his high number of pass breakups. He plays with ballhawking eyes and good balance from zone coverage and is very aggressive tackling both after the catch and in run support. There are snaps where he gets behind and stays behind due to a lack of premium speed and closing burst, so he might require help over the top or a more zone-oriented scheme to help him shine. The playmaking mentality and traits give him a solid chance to become a CB2 in the league.",6.47,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devon-witherspoon/32005749-5414-3920-4168-4be52b4fc3cf
Myles Murphy,"Murphy has excellent size/traits and has been consistently productive in impact categories for three straight years. He plays with a plus motor and good first-step quickness, but his game isn‚Äôt really twitchy or explosive. He has finishing talent when he‚Äôs inside the pocket, but he needs to vary his rush angles and find an effective inside counter, as NFL tackles will be expecting his long-arm bull-rush technique. Murphy‚Äôs length and post-up strength could provide the scheme and positional versatility that puts him on every draft board. The traits and upside are there, but his skill level needs a boost to push the ceiling higher.",6.42,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/myles-murphy/32004d55-5251-9902-72e4-8874355105ea
Joey Porter Jr.,"Ascending cornerback combining traits and above average play strength that create a clear definition of who he is as a player. He can reroute the release and has the frame to close catch windows against big receivers in press-man or Cover 2 looks. Delayed transitions and sluggish change of direction put him in conflict in off coverages, so teams must pay attention to matchups and scheme in order to avoid a field full of yellow laundry. There is work to be done to improve tackle consistency in the run game, but he finishes tackles after a catch. Porter has scheme limitations, but he also has CB1 potential with more work and if utilized properly.",6.42,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joey-porter-jr/3200504f-5277-3442-9f31-894fa5a2ca5d
Will McDonald IV,"McDonald is an explosive, pliable edge talent whose active hands and eager feet make it hard for tackles to get a firm grip on him. His burst and lower-body flexion give him an advantage at the top of the rush, while his spin moves and feel for pocket depth round out his attack. He has good strength for his size and plays with admirable contact balance against bigger players, but setting firm edges and holding his ground against a downhill running attack could be an issue. Overall, McDonald‚Äôs hard-nosed demeanor and pass-rush talent are winning play traits that will help him become a successful 3-4 outside linebacker and sack artist.",6.41,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-mcdonald-iv/32004d43-4459-9665-e69d-a74762fc7e67
John Michael Schmitz,"Schmitz is a highly consistent zone-scheme center with decent size. He is well-schooled in all phases of the run game. He consistently uses the proper footwork and angles to find early positioning and has the tenacity to finish blocks at a high rate. He has plus football intelligence and makes the calls for his offense. His drive power is average and he can be hit-or-miss getting to second-level targets. Schmitz lacks length and his edges will get a little leaky in pass protection from time to time, but his overall technique and teamwork in the run game should create a plug-and-play opportunity in the pros.",6.41,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-michael-schmitz/32005343-4836-7249-e8ba-7c4c69915992
DJ Turner II,"Explosive athlete combining fluidity, speed and superior technique to excel at his craft. Turner is scheme-diverse with the ability to line up inside or outside in coverage. He‚Äôs graceful with his mirror and match movements from press or off-man coverage, but he is plenty feisty when challenging throws or hitting receivers after the catch. Despite his competitiveness, big receivers can bounce him around and beat him on 50/50 balls. Turner has the tools and talent to become an early starter as a nickel corner capable of matching up with both shifty and speedy opponents.",6.41,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dj-turner-ii/32005455-5228-3151-d0bf-492aa1a59230
Anthony Richardson,"Dual-threat quarterback with an elite physical profile and a lot of work that needs to be done to reach a potentially high ceiling. Richardson‚Äôs frame, arm talent and mobility will demand respect as a potential first-round option. He has the ability to make plays on the move that very few of his NFL peers will be able to make. However, but his accuracy on short and simple throws left much to be desired due, in part, to shoddy footwork and inconsistent rhythm. The footwork issues can be corrected, but the challenge will be determining whether he can be at least a functionally accurate passer at the next level. Richardson‚Äôs potential to strike with the deep ball, attack the secondary from sideline to sideline and gash teams with his legs creates greater leeway in his projection as a developmental prospect. Ultimately, he will succeed or fail based on his ability to play with better post-snap recognition and deliver the football with consistency.",6.4,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-richardson/32005249-4338-7833-9fd1-1d5e168eb504
Lukas Van Ness,"Nicknamed ‚ÄúHercules‚Äù by teammates, Van Ness is a well-developed defensive end with excellent lean mass and additional growth still to come. He‚Äôs a power-centric prospect with force as his modus operandi as both a run defender and pass rusher. Van Ness needs to work on hand attacks for quicker block shedding and to diversify his rush beyond bull-rush challenges. He‚Äôs taken snaps inside at Iowa but might need to keep filling out his frame before he‚Äôs ready to succeed as a run stuffer and pass rusher as a 4i in a 3-4 front. Van Ness is more of a splash player than consistent force on tape, but he possesses projectable traits that should allow for continued ascension as a pro.",6.4,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lukas-van-ness/32005641-4e63-9767-91e9-a7147693e290
Darnell Wright,"Right tackle prospect who used his size and power to overcome athletic limitations and spotty technique on the collegiate level. The tape can be a little uneven for Wright with poor block finishes followed up by aggressive pancakes. He played with much better body control and footwork in 2022, though. Wright is capable of staying at right tackle at the next level provided he‚Äôs given protection help from time to time. While he was often a positional blocker at Tennessee, he‚Äôs a very talented drive blocker when allowed to fire out. There will be inconsistent outings, but Wright should develop into a decent starting tackle with the potential to kick inside if necessary.",6.4,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darnell-wright/32005752-4915-3639-216c-bcc7afd9f5d5
Matthew Bergeron,"A college tackle who could be best playing inside at guard, Bergeron is evenly proportioned and wears his weight well on a compact frame. He‚Äôs a dynamic run blocker, able to excel in all three phases (positioning, sustain and finish). He‚Äôs just as capable of climbing and tagging second-level linebackers as he is at opening run lanes at the point of attack with leg drive. He‚Äôs athletic enough to play tackle, but inconsistent anchor and hand placement could cause concern for evaluators. While his protection issues are potentially correctable, Bergeron‚Äôs scheme-versatile, Pro Bowl-caliber run-blocking potential might hasten a team‚Äôs decision to move him inside.",6.39,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matthew-bergeron/32004245-5210-0937-e984-90feb04718cc
Paris Johnson Jr.,"Long, athletic tackle in need of additional technique work but possessing the traits to become a long-time starter on the left side. Johnson is still filling out his frame and he should get stronger. He‚Äôs much better as a move blocker than man blocker but he can bridge that gap with more coaching. He‚Äôs loose and quick in pass protection but will need to add core strength and get better with inside hands to prevent edge defenders from bypassing his anchor. Johnson‚Äôs athletic tools and position versatility are advantageous but the going could be a little bumpy early on before he settles in.",6.39,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/paris-johnson-jr/32004a4f-4878-9993-54f7-5fb6cbb7b88b
Quentin Johnston,"Height-weight-speed prospect with the physical traits and upside that might have teams willing to overlook some of his inconsistencies on tape. Johnston is a long-striding vertical threat who can open up and separate when allowed to keep his feet moving in space. His elevation and catch radius create an expansive target area down the field, but his overall success rate on contested catches is way lower than it should be for a receiver of his size. Johnston needs a specific route tree, but will improve in that area at the next level. He will benefit from a more accurate deep-ball quarterback, but still feels more like a good WR2 than a high-volume WR1.",6.39,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quentin-johnston/32004a4f-4882-3261-dcd8-a43c8f7c5608
Calijah Kancey,"Undersized, one-gapping defensive tackle who is explosive and productive. He‚Äôs a strong and determined player, but Kancey is still going to be a hit-or-miss run defender due to his lack of mass and length. While he will get pushed around at times, his first-step quickness and short memory allow him to make tackles in the backfield. He‚Äôs a nightmare for offenses as a pass rusher. His twitchy feet can slide and reset points of attack. His leverage and motor are often too much for guards to handle alone. Kancey might be most effective as a rotational run defender and full-time, sub-package rusher, but his size will not define him in the NFL.",6.39,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/calijah-kancey/32004b41-4e04-6143-5a2e-df476a2bfc64
Kelee Ringo,"Boundary corner with an impressive blend of size and athleticism. Ringo is uniquely suited to travel the field and match talents against some of the bigger targets in the league. He can press and does a nice job of controlling plays in front of him from off coverages. However, he is very average at anticipating breaks and transitioning with them to squeeze the top of the route. His physicality in coverage and in run support are big assets in his favor, but there is still work to be done in consistency of coverage. Ringo‚Äôs traits will be highly coveted and he has a chance to become a very good NFL cornerback if his route recognition continues to develop.",6.39,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kelee-ringo/32005249-4e50-4723-3a49-9257661a7422
Cedric Tillman,"Highly competitive wideout with an enticing blend of size, skill and toughness that fits what teams look for in an NFL starter. Tillman was a monster in 2021, ringing up impressive performances against the likes of Alabama and Georgia. He proved he could catch the ball through contact underneath while imposing his size and ball skills on opponents when pulling in the deep ball. He has average speed and needs to play with better explosiveness out of his breaks, as NFL windows will become much tighter on the first two levels. A high ankle sprain suffered in the third game of the season robbed him of a highly productive 2022, but his toughness to make it back early and compete late in the year has impressed evaluators.",6.38,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cedric-tillman/32005449-4c37-7067-218b-007e17161edd
O'Cyrus Torrence,"Broad guard prospect whose physical limitations are balanced by his feel for the job and ability to use his size in his favor. Torrence is not a natural bender. He is forced to engulf and push rather than leverage and drive as a run blocker, but he‚Äôs solid at neutralizing the man across from him. He uses his hands well to jab and maintain feel for the rush, but quick interior rushers with well-developed counters could be too much for his limited foot quickness to handle without help. He projects as a future starter for downhill offenses who covet size over athleticism.",6.38,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/o-cyrus-torrence/3200544f-5269-4111-dab8-fa9ef6354288
Tuli Tuipulotu,"Defender possessing the rare blend of size, strength and athleticism to line up as an interior or edge defender in both 4-3 and 3-4 fronts. Tuipulotu plays with a go-go motor from the first snap to the last. His heavy-handed attack and ability to shed help compensate for a lack of length at the point of attack, while quick feet help him disrupt in gaps. He can play with a hand down or standing but needs to play with better discipline to eliminate voided fits. Tuipulotu is a power-based rusher with decent bend and flatten talent but he‚Äôs unlikely to win with his get-off alone. He should become a good starter.",6.38,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tuli-tuipulotu/32005455-4972-0077-cdfc-f4d029d13b39
Darnell Washington,"In-line tight end with rare size and power at the point of attack to help soften defensive edges up front. Despite sloppy overall technique, Washington can be effective at moving defenders when he‚Äôs centered on his block. He must improve his footwork and hand usage, as NFL defenders will slip away from his clutches more easily if he‚Äôs unsound. He plods into his routes but catches with above-average focus and can be a handful to bring down. Washington could become a dominant run blocker with better technique, which makes me wonder if a team might give him a look at offensive tackle at some point in his career.",6.38,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darnell-washington/32005741-5318-5860-3ee1-1aca1e440e91
Deonte Banks,"Perimeter corner with desired blend of size, strength and athleticism. Banks is capable of release disruption from press. He plays with smooth hips and easy feet to pedal and glide around the field. He‚Äôs capable of matching the release and running with his opponent. However, he struggles to play with poise and awareness when his back is to the football. He needs to play with better route anticipation and reactive quickness at the break point, but his eye-popping NFL Scouting Combine testing and scheme versatility should create interest from a wide range of NFL teams. Banks has first-round traits and could become a CB1 if he can play with better discipline when challenged.",6.37,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deonte-banks/32004241-4e46-2444-9957-08e48a0cf8b6
Jahmyr Gibbs,"While Gibbs might not be the engine of an NFL running game, he‚Äôs more than capable of adding juice to the offense. He‚Äôs a slasher who can stretch defenses wide, and he has the wiggle to elude tacklers in space. However, he could see his effectiveness diminished inside. Gibbs might be better off with a more measured carry count as an RB2, but his versatility and pass-catching prowess will give creative play-callers an opportunity to exploit certain personnel groupings and find mismatches in space.",6.37,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jahmyr-gibbs/32004749-4219-8578-ca06-2b870fe6f731
Derick Hall,"Explosive and long, Hall plays with a rugged demeanor and puts his traits to work as an assertive power rusher capable of putting offensive tackles in reverse. He tends to lack consistency when forced to read and react in the run game and his rush approach is predictable with charges down the fairway. However, his jolting initial contact can help him gain positioning and he‚Äôs excellent at transitioning from bulldozer to pocket vulture as a sack artist. He is average against the run, exploitable in coverage and in need of a more diversified rush approach, but a true power rush usually translates in the NFL.",6.37,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derick-hall/32004841-4c27-4589-50da-dbb78b921d81
Jordan Addison,"Inside/outside wideout with the speed and agility to work confidently on all three levels of the field, but lacking the size and catch strength generally associated with high-impact performers on the next level. Addison‚Äôs route running features acceleration, dynamic steering and sudden turns at a moment‚Äôs notice. While he can get to the spot effectively, he has trouble consistently winning battles when he has coverage company beside him. While Addison failed to make the same impact he did in 2021, his usage at Pitt might be a better indicator of the type of role and production he could be capable of on the next level.",6.36,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-addison/32004144-4449-1056-9ba9-b09766bad478
Emmanuel Forbes,"Forbes is long, can run and has a talent for taking the ball away, which means he has a chance to become a coveted cornerback. However, his wire-thin frame does not work in his favor. Forbes‚Äô instincts and recognition are fun to watch. He pounces on quick-game throws and has the ball skills to take the ball away. He‚Äôs highly capable in all forms of zone coverage and operates out of press-man, but is inconsistent matching the release and staying in phase with routes through sharp cuts. His slender build and lack of tackle strength will make him a target for opposing running games. Forbes could become an early starter with quality ball production, but teams might need to expect some up-and-down performances.",6.36,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/emmanuel-forbes/3200464f-5201-3942-ca3a-fc490c35893e
Cody Mauch,"Mauch‚Äôs two front teeth are missing (they were knocked out during a junior high basketball game) and he wears a big mop of shoulder-length red hair, so you get the sense you are about to watch a hockey player on turf when you turn on the game tape. As expected, Mauch is a rugged player with an attacking demeanor who does his most consistent work as a drive blocker in the run game. Inconsistent footwork in pass protection and below average arm length could foreshadow a move inside to guard, where he is capable of competing for a starting job as a scheme-versatile tough guy.",6.36,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cody-mauch/32004d41-5508-8990-a189-9a0d7947a282
Luke Schoonmaker,"Versatile combination tight end capable of performing a variety of tasks in one-, two- or three-tight end sets. Schoonmaker steps foot on the field ready for action as a run blocker and does a nice job of competing in the entry and sustain phases of the block. He will need to add more muscle and play strength but already has a feel for creating run-lane angles with his footwork. He has the athletic talent to run a slightly expanded route tree, but he needs to do a better job of competing aggressively for catch space and meeting throws with extended hands. He could see action early but might need a year or so before he works himself into a full-time TE2 role.",6.36,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/luke-schoonmaker/32005343-4847-1986-19e8-9065e5ea32c8
Bryan Bresee,"Burly but athletic interior tackle who plays with a strong desire to get past the man in front of him. Bresee rarely gets caught up in long block engagements and possesses a deep anchor to battle double teams. He operates with subtle hand fighting that helps puts pressure on blockers but currently lacks the rush sophistication and shed technique to make more plays in the backfield. If he can stay healthy and gain much-needed experience, Bresee should continue to progress at his position and become a good run defender with an ability to disrupt the pocket within his first few NFL seasons.",6.35,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryan-bresee/32004252-4551-0679-d769-a1a0d80e7931
Isaiah Foskey,"Forward-charging edge defender whose best football could be ahead of him. He relies heavily on a long-arm rush attack and with a ghost move counter, but he‚Äôll need to more effectively use his rush hands to help trip the edge as he lacks hip flexion to consistently dip and flatten to quarterbacks. His pressing play style and range in space should create opportunities to cause disruptions, but he lacks anchor as an edge-setter and needs to go to school with take-on technique. There are slight limitations in his game, but he‚Äôs going to keep getting better and has future starting potential as a 4-3 defensive end.",6.35,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-foskey/3200464f-5308-1863-3f04-6cde65dd0aa3
BJ Ojulari,"Stand-up rush linebacker with upside as a pass rusher but inconsistent effort stopping the run. Ojulari is bendy as an edge rusher and will wreak substantially more pocket havoc once he builds a more complete rush plan. He plays contain as a run defender and has the pursuit speed to spill the run wide or make tackles in space, but needs to play with consistent effort on all run snaps. B.J. Ojulari possesses all the tools necessary to start for an NFL team once he adds a bit more polish to his game.",6.35,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bj-ojulari/32004f4a-5542-6541-4cd9-8e817d1b5514
Tyler Scott,"While the comparison to T.Y. Hilton might raise some eyebrows, Scott is a similar player in body type, speed and versatility. With just two seasons of starting experience at receiver, his route running and ball skills are almost certain to continue to improve and become less of an issue for him in the future. He has the speed and shiftiness to uncover on all three levels. Also, he offers jet sweep and receiver screen value. A smallish frame and lack of hand strength are likely to continue to plague him on contested catches, though. Scott is an ascending talent whose versatility and playmaking talent create an easily projectable upside as a good starting slot receiver early in his career.",6.35,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-scott/32005343-4f71-9390-286c-9940bb34941f
Joe Tippmann,"Two-year starter with the weight room strength and athleticism for work in a variety of run schemes. Tippmann is taller than your average center, but he can bend enough to neutralize at the point of attack. He‚Äôs a fluid move blocker who can make wide pulls, climbing cut-offs and adjustments to moving targets in space. He‚Äôs recognized for his football intelligence in the pivot and is an effective communicator. He needs to play with better posture and tighter hands to stay mirrored in protection and to improve his body control through engagement. Tippmann‚Äôs size, strength, smarts and athleticism should help him become a starter in the NFL.",6.35,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-tippmann/32005449-5025-9555-6ace-30a99e2db1c4
Felix Anudike-Uzomah,"A hard-charging edge prospect, Anudike-Uzomah has good strength and a long frame that should continue to fill out. His run defense is unrefined and in need of better fundamentals, but he‚Äôs clearly gone to school on his pass-rush approach, adding several new wrinkles to his attack in 2022. His urgency leads to playmaking opportunities, but he will need to harness that energy and play with better control to become a more efficient defender. There is more polish needed, but Anudike-Uzomah‚Äôs NFL rush potential should eventually make him an NFL starter.",6.34,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/felix-anudike-uzomah/3200414e-5541-5291-dc35-8fecbffa9ee6
Siaki Ika,"Girthy interior force with heavy hands and a combative nature at the point of attack. Ika is made for gap control with his wide frame and ready anchor. While he has the potential to become a highly effective block-eater as an odd or even front nose tackle, he‚Äôs quick enough off the snap to penetrate and disrupt play design if teams try to block him one-on-one. While he‚Äôs unlikely to see passing downs, Ika does have enough athleticism and hand work to challenge the pocket from time to time. If he‚Äôs able to manage his weight, Ika could become an early starter and help improve a leaky run defense.",6.34,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/siaki-ika/3200494b-4141-5291-2dea-662f23193178
Antonio Johnson,"Big, athletic safety with versatility to line up over the slot or inside the box for additional run support. Johnson has a strong passion for sticking his nose into whatever is going on near the line of scrimmage. He‚Äôs constantly flowing downhill to meet the play as close to the line of scrimmage as possible, but he needs to regulate his pace and angles to prevent overflowing and poor tackle balance. Johnson can be overmatched at the top of the route by top-end receivers, but he's capable of staying with pass-catching tight ends or a receiver with average speed. Johnson is positioned to become a good starter whose best ball will be played near the line of scrimmage.",6.34,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antonio-johnson/32004a4f-4806-1167-a48a-d4b74b81a5a9
Will Levis,"Levis is one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in the draft, but there are warts in his game that might not be easily corrected. He has prototypical size and experience operating in a pro-style passing attack. He‚Äôs an athletic passer, with the ability to zip off-platform throws with plus velocity from a compact release. He struggled to put together an extended period of high-caliber quarterback play in 2022, but was also dealing with injuries that he fought his way through for much of the season. Levis has the arm to beat coverages on all three levels, but inadequate placement and accuracy have created a lot of uncatchable throws. He‚Äôs a capable runner outside the pocket but needs to improve his feel for pressure and his consistency when throwing on the move. Levis‚Äô talent is well worth an investment, but could require a talented quarterback coach and a patient plan to tighten up his mechanics, rebuild his confidence and explore an offensive scheme that best suits him.",6.34,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-levis/32004c45-5660-4187-2b50-c23ff4a6e28e
Mazi Smith,"Dontari Poe might be the physical and athletic player comparison for Smith, but more consistency from Smith is needed before he finds the Pro Bowl, as Poe did twice in his career. Smith‚Äôs blend of size and quickness is rare. He can punch and control a base block with relative ease. However, he struggles to match the initial movement of move blockers, which diminishes his effectiveness. He has space-eating potential but needs to become more consistent at taking on double teams and securing his gap. Smith‚Äôs size and testing could give his draft slotting some juice but he‚Äôs more of a Day 2 talent with exciting upside than a plug-and-play starter.",6.34,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mazi-smith/3200534d-4951-1850-a3da-289c89c7e5d4
Nolan Smith,"Lower weight class edge defender with the toughness to mix it up with bigger players. Based purely upon his sleek but smallish frame, one might expect him to be more effective as a rusher than run defender but the opposite is true. Smith is hard to move off of his spot due to his technique and leverage, and he can be disruptive when firing into gaps. He can get off the mark as a rusher, but lacks the counters and contact balance to consistently assault the pocket at a high rate. Smith falls below the size standards some team might have for a 3-4 outside linebacker, but he plays team-first defense with quality technique that should help him translate to the pros.",6.33,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nolan-smith/3200534d-4953-6848-fd4d-2f73557d06ca
Dawand Jones,"Massive right tackle with rare length but limited athleticism that impacts his consistency. Defenders accustomed to winning with power will need to switch up their approach against Jones. His physical traits help cover up some of his athletic deficiencies, while his power can be better unleashed with accurate hand strikes and a run scheme tailored to what he does best. The former high school basketball standout has decent slide quickness in protection but is unable to find his feet when attempting to match inside counters or stall out gaming fronts. Jones is a work in progress with holes that will have to be covered up with scheme help, but he should become a starting right tackle if he maintains the playing weight his team desires.",6.32,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dawand-jones/32004a4f-4e23-2777-93b6-b85cf0fe618b
Steve Avila,"Three-year starter who offers versatility, power and athleticism. Playing at a lighter weight should not be a problem if teams want that from him. His girth makes him resistant to opposing power, and he‚Äôs light enough on his feet for pass protection duties and run blocks that extend beyond the box. He‚Äôs not a consistently nasty finisher and below average hand work has a clear impact on his ability to sustain blocks. Avila is likely to start right away as a Day 2 draft pick and should have a solid NFL career as either a guard or center.",6.3,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/steve-avila/32004156-4938-1004-f099-2e0d50c5f73d
Ji'Ayir Brown,"Versatile defensive back who has shown the ability to line up over the slot, play as a down safety and patrol the outfield as a Cover 1 safety ready to read and range. The lack of speed and explosiveness Brown showed at the NFL Scouting Combine won‚Äôt help his draft stock, but he‚Äôs a fiery run defender and plays with undeniable coverage instincts. He has an excellent motor that fuels him throughout the game, as well. He needs to play with a little more discipline or veteran quarterbacks and play-callers will bait him into mistakes. Brown‚Äôs versatility and football character could help him eventually become an NFL starter.",6.3,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ji-ayir-brown/32004252-4f49-2777-600c-5206658f7fd5
Terell Smith,"Ascending cornerback with an outstanding combination of size, speed and toughness. Smith‚Äôs technique and game film improved from 2021 to 2022. He stays low and patient in his backpedal. He has above-average footwork for a cornerback his size, which allows him to mirror the release and stay connected to the deep route. He‚Äôs experienced in playing all forms of coverage, but he‚Äôs best from press and off-man. Smith is a reliable tackler with a playing disposition that matches expectations for NFL run support. The on-ball production is a little light, but the traits and talent are in place for a starting role at outside cornerback in the future or a transition to safety.",6.29,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terell-smith/3200534d-4973-9042-a2e5-7a611c3c3214
Julius Brents,"Brents is a classic zone cover corner with an outstanding blend of size, length and leaping ability. He has the disruptive traits to reroute the release and the dog in him to handle his business in run support. He can play some press-man on a vertical plane but lacks the top-end speed and pattern matching to play in that scheme full-time. Brents needs to maintain eye discipline from zone but has the ball skills to win a battle for the pass when he‚Äôs in position. While he‚Äôs likely to be targeted in the draft as a zone-based corner, he has the instincts and demeanor to make a move to safety if needed.",6.28,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/julius-brents/32004252-4551-0110-2798-7a9b05aa2760
Tucker Kraft,"Combination tight end with the projectable skill set to handle pass-catching and run-blocking duties at the next level. Currently, he‚Äôs a more effective blocker in space than in-line, but that is correctable with better hand usage and proper angles of entry into his base blocks. Kraft provides formational versatility that will be appealing for teams that make heavy use of 12 personnel (two tight ends). He has the body control and catch toughness to be more than just a traditional Y tight end. Kraft has Day 2 talent and should see the field early with a chance to become a TE1.",6.28,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tucker-kraft/32004b52-4114-4054-e146-c099ad4f2842
Anton Harrison,"Collegiate left tackle with good size and length, but average athletic traits. Harrison is self-aware and does a nice job of utilizing his strengths to mask his weaknesses. He has a feel for pocket depth and uses his length and an inside-out approach to get the job done, but NFL speed could have him scrambling without help. Harrison lacks the pop and drive of a plus run blocker and is better at neutralizing opponents with proper positioning. There are some limitations athletically and it won‚Äôt always look fluid, but Harrison has the demeanor and football savvy to get the job done as a starter in time.",6.27,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anton-harrison/32004841-5257-5324-7acd-121b32d76e46
Jaquelin Roy,"The more you watch, the more you like the way Roy plays the game. He‚Äôs a little tight in his lower body, which prevents consistent gap leverage as a run defender, but he has outstanding upper body power and plays with unbridled energy. Roy has one-gapping snap quickness and two-gapping potential if he can become more consistent with taking on blocks. Despite limited starting experience at LSU, he already displays signs of a rush plan and the athletic talent to execute it. Roy is an ascending talent with the potential to become a quality starter.",6.27,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaquelin-roy/3200524f-5928-3610-1053-35c00d6d295a
Cam Smith,"Long outside cornerback with instinctive eyes and the ball skills to consistently close on throws when in position. Smith lacks fluidity and acceleration to consistently press and run with speedy downfield targets. Also, he gives ground in his lateral transitions. However, he‚Äôs highly anticipatory with the vision and route recognition to shine from coverages allowing him to play with his eyes and feet forward. While his timing/length can be formidable weapons on contested catches, he often fails to move his feet quickly enough in transitions and ends up grabbing receivers, leading to penalties. Smith appears to be better suited for zone coverages and off-man but if he can trust his technique, he might become more scheme-diverse and develop into a CB2.",6.27,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-smith/3200534d-4909-8020-4c6f-60f2e2c8bfc6
Marvin Mims Jr.,"Mims is a long-striding wideout who will primarily line up inside, but he has the potential to be moved around to mismatch speed-deficient coverage. He ran a limited route tree at Oklahoma, but he has the athletic qualities to expand on it at the next level. He‚Äôs athletic in space and dangerous with the ball in his hands, but he‚Äôs likely to see the 50/50 throws tilt in the other direction. Has can work on all three levels of the field and is an above average punt returner. Mims has just average size and strength, but his ability to create explosive plays could push him into a Day 2 selection and a starting role in the future.",6.28,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marvin-mims-jr/32004d49-4d65-4774-4051-580758dd257c
A.T. Perry,"Long wideout with quick feet and erratic hands who falls neatly into the category of higher-ceiling, lower-floor prospect. Perry has been highly targeted and highly productive over the last two seasons. He‚Äôs crafty but physical in the early stages of the route and flashes the ability to become a more dangerous route runner with additional work. He has the tools to work all three levels of the field, but his drops and ordinary ball skills sap some of the excitement surrounding his massive wingspan. Perry‚Äôs inconsistencies can be frustrating, but his talent and traits make him worthy of a Day 2 selection as a potential WR2/3.",6.26,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a-t-perry/32005045-5253-2468-5893-9308cc0d5b93
Clark Phillips III,"Phillips might not be a big, long cornerback, but he‚Äôs a playmaker. He has the play traits to continue down that same path as a pro. He‚Äôs a voracious student of the game and has developed a feel for reading the quarterback‚Äôs drops and eyes. He‚Äôs a little tight-hipped and can give away separation at the top of the route, but when he‚Äôs clued in, Phillips uses aggressive angles to search for takeaways. He‚Äôs tough, smart and knows how to play. He should become a solid nickel cornerback, but his success could be tethered to matchups from week to week.",6.26,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clark-phillips-iii/32005048-4967-2138-705f-d3b4ab36a39f
Rejzohn Wright,"Scheme-versatile outside cornerback with the talent and skill to become a successful starter in the league. Wright possesses the physical traits to contest throws in the NFL, but it‚Äôs his footwork and anticipation that keep him near receivers to make plays on the football. He‚Äôs very agile to mirror and phase routes from man coverage but will need to play with a bit more awareness from zone. Wright‚Äôs ceiling could be determined by his ability to open and run with deep targets, and his willingness to step up a little more in run support.",6.26,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rejzohn-wright/32005752-4963-1850-24c7-68a3f57095d3
Keeanu Benton,"Benton is a powerful interior defensive lineman with size and persistence. However, he needs to play with consistent explosiveness early in the rep for decisive wins at the point of attack at the pro level. Block engagements become drawn-out brawls at times, but he does a nice job of defeating block sustains and often finds himself near the play. He lacks a wide base and sturdy anchor, so he‚Äôll need to improve his pad level to prevent double teams from moving him around too easily. He‚Äôs solid and has flashed starting potential, but he needs to become a more consistently impactful force in the middle to make noise as an NFL starter.",6.25,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keeanu-benton/32004245-4e72-8037-3a5b-4117a2df7f2d
Tank Dell,"Every second of the route is a separation opportunity for Dell, a touchdown-making machine who pairs electrifying top-end speed with twitchy short-area quickness. His routes are fast and effective on all three levels with keen ball-tracking talent deep and sideline-dotting footwork. Focus drops and contested catches are ongoing issues that are likely to continue at the next level. Dell is dangerous with the ball in his hands after the catch and as a game-changing punt returner. His slender frame is a concern, but the explosive talent could be difficult to pass up for teams needing a big-play weapon to stretch the field and mismatch coverages.",6.3,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tank-dell/32004445-4c44-0817-a646-b67c3fe533fb
Zach Evans,"Evans‚Äô career average of 6.9 yards per carry demonstrates his home run ability, but nagging injuries have limited him in the last two seasons. Teams will need to examine his injury history and determine whether it‚Äôs a concern for them or not. He has lead back size and impresses with his willingness to fight through contact for additional yardage on most runs. His vision and creativity are average at best, but the talent/traits should put him in contention for early carries as a very good complementary back with future RB1 upside.",6.25,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-evans/32004556-4181-2057-89cd-cc42654bef9d
JL Skinner,Interchangeable safety with above average run support talent and the versatility for multiple coverages. Skinner plays with good awareness to routes with eyes for short zone and the instincts to play over the top. He can line up over pass-catching tight ends and has the ball skills to make quarterbacks pay for off-target throws. He has good feet but hips that can be a little sticky when flipping to run with vertical routes. His agility and range help him as a tackle collector in the open field. Skinner should become an above average starter within a couple of seasons.,6.25,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jl-skinner/3200534b-4962-3722-bd01-af6ca68de04d
Israel Abanikanda,"A zone-scheme runner with early down size, Abanikanda can be a bit inconsistent with his reads and tempo early in the run. However, he has plant-and-go agility and is able to snap off cuts at tight angles to elude short-area traffic when needed. He has terrific top-end speed to gash a poorly fitted run front, but he needs to run with better discipline and downhill decisiveness to stay ahead of NFL speed. Abanikanda isn't much of a third down option, but he does have the size and talent to compete for a RB2/3 slot early on with a chance to move up the depth chart in time.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/israel-abanikanda/32004142-4115-9567-2e24-0eab29f6a4b9
Joey Fisher,"Three-year starter and team captain with NFL size, toughness and athletic qualities. Fisher bullied his level of competition on a regular basis. He‚Äôs thick and powerful with the clinch strength and balance to sustain blocks through contact, but a move up in competition will surely test him right out of the gate. Fisher plays with more advanced elements of pass protection than is typical of his level of competition. His lateral quickness and athleticism should have him set as a move blocker and when mirroring athletic rushers in protection. Fisher has the traits and talent to slide from tackle to guard and become a solid NFL starter.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joey-fisher/32004649-5343-7779-ed1f-1637254463d0
Jonathan Mingo,"Big, strong slot receiver possessing the mental and physical toughness to outperform his speed limitations. The career production is nothing special, but it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs put time and effort into his craft. He runs crisp, well-paced routes and ramps up his focus when it‚Äôs time to go get the football. A lack of separation burst and long speed could make for more contested catches, but he has the body type and willingness for that work. Mingo can get tough yards after the catch and is an above-average blocker. He has the skill level and demeanor to become a starting slot receiver for teams using 11 personnel (three WRs) as their base offense.",6.27,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-mingo/32004d49-4e17-0999-c137-d684c1d1ab38
Zacch Pickens,"Athletic interior defender with experience and length as a gap-control tackle but the quickness and play traits that might be better-suited to attacking upfield. Pickens has a disruptive first step that creates advantages for him as both a run defender and pass rusher. He plays with harmonious hands and feet to elude blockers or play off them, but he‚Äôs likely to get moved around by NFL drive blockers. Pickens has the ability to play both tackle spots in a one-gapping front and has rotational value with the potential to see starter‚Äôs reps.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zacch-pickens/32005049-4370-5993-8fbe-6294065cc4d2
Trenton Simpson,"Chiseled weakside linebacker with rare speed for the position to run down the action in all directions. Simpson played inside in 2022 but displayed average play recognition and a lack of patience that saw him get caught in traffic near the line. He can play run-and-hit football with his speed when playing outside. He needs to cut back the arm tackles and pursue with better angles to the ball. He‚Äôs a premium athlete capable of squeezing routes from zone and attacking the pocket as a blitzer. Simpson isn‚Äôt quite game-ready yet, but players with his traits and range eventually find the field.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trenton-simpson/32005349-4d63-2785-a5d9-70beadf55418
Tyrique Stevenson,"Big cornerback with the size and play strength to help match up with bigger receivers in the league. Stevenson is patient but physical in press-man and has good recovery speed when he falls behind. He struggles as a pattern matcher in off-man and had issues with busts in zone, so he might be scheme-dependent. Stevenson is talented when attacking the catch point and has the ball skills to make plays on 50/50 throws. He needs to become more consistent in run support but has the physical attributes to become a starter in a press-man scheme.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyrique-stevenson/32005354-4571-6698-d1af-a62614e4d25d
Andrew Vorhees,"Guard prospect with five years of starting experience that shows itself with consistency and football IQ. Vorhees is a technically sound run blocker with a repeatable process. His range laterally and to the second level will be a little limited, but he‚Äôs an even-paced drive blocker, using excellent positioning, leveraged hands and churning legs. He needs to get quicker with inside hands in pass protection and guard against trying to protect his edges with his hands rather than a foot slide. The injury he suffered during his NFL Scouting Combine workout could cause him to fall in the draft, but he has the potential to become a starter when he‚Äôs fully healthy.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-vorhees/3200564f-5214-8318-1d8d-426c413b6104
Chandler Zavala,"Guard prospect with a broad base, limited athleticism and an above-average talent for driving opponents out of the run lane. While Zavala can be a step slow getting out of his stance and into positioning as a move blocker, he does have experience in just about every run blocking scheme. He has the pure power to match up with NFL interior defenders as a drive blocker. He plays with heavy hands and a wide base as both a run and pass blocker. Limited reactive agility will lead to him getting beat in protection and by downhill linebackers, but he has the size and ability to eventually become a starter.",6.24,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chandler-zavala/32005a41-5607-0576-eb71-62de76a91a52
Devon Achane,"Finding a player comparison for Achane is challenging because he has blazing speed and is fearless as an inside runner, but is very small by NFL standards. He has the creativity and burst to create chunk plays but durability concerns will likely limit the amount of carries a team is willing to give him. Achane can be a complementary slasher with the ability to mismatch coverage out of the backfield or from the slot. However, he‚Äôs simply too talented and explosive as a runner to be confined to gadget duty. History does not favor backs his size, but his playmaking potential could be too tough to pass up on Day 2 of the draft.",6.23,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devon-achane/32004143-4810-3822-6a71-b10965e0a57a
Jordan Battle,"Battle offers the size, speed and pedigree to become a starter early in his NFL career. Film study shows a certain sageness to his game. He is usually where he needs to be on the field and helps his defense move on to the next play. He‚Äôs athletic enough for man coverage and is field-aware as a split safety. He‚Äôs not a thumper in run support and will miss tackles when he‚Äôs slow to find his positioning, but he typically finishes plays that are in front of him. Battle has the physical and mental makeup to upgrade a defense in need of steady safety play.",6.23,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-battle/32004241-5447-2711-9552-583ca389703b
Zach Charbonnet,Upright runner with outstanding body composition and consecutive seasons of impressive production for the Bruins. Charbonnet is a bit of a long-strider with slightly below average foot quickness. He is much more effective when allowed to open up and build downhill momentum. He can slip tackles in the open field but lacks the first-level wiggle to get too cute. He‚Äôs inconsistent in processing defensive fronts quickly but can be a hammer into and through contact when he has a clear point of entry. Charbonnet is a talented third-down option as both a blocker and pass-catcher. He could be viewed as a Day 2 value with three-down potential.,6.23,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-charbonnet/32004348-4154-8773-f098-b6f992d916a2
Emil Ekiyor Jr.,"Guard prospect who plays with the calm and consistency expected from a three-year starter at Alabama. Ekiyor is shorter than teams might like, but he‚Äôs girthy and plays with excellent fundamentals from snap to whistle. He‚Äôs an adequate athlete suited for inside zone and gap scheme runs. Footwork and hand placement are helpful but he‚Äôs likely to have issues dealing with space-eaters and bull-rushers who can generate pocket push against him. Ultimately, Ekiyor is both smart and sound with how he plays the position and could have staying power as a future starter.",6.23,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/emil-ekiyor-jr/3200454b-4978-2506-4e68-612fd858d592
Hendon Hooker,"Hooker‚Äôs age and ACL tear will be starting points for many draft conversations, but the most important question to be answered is whether he can thrive outside of the Tennessee offense. Hooker was frequently a half-field reader, which means he could lean on spacing, speed and/or route combinations to make life easier. He‚Äôs more accurate outside the numbers than between the hashes and his deep ball placement was much more uneven than expected. However, Hooker plays with excellent poise and footwork as a pocket passer. He will make quarterback coaches and play-callers happy with his adherence to keeping plays on schedule. He‚Äôs still showing signs of improvement and growth at the position, and his ability to hurt teams with his legs creates opportunities to help his offense outside of what he does in the pocket. His recovery from the ACL tear will require monitoring, but he has the talent to become a starter in a timing-based, spread offense.",6.23,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hendon-hooker/3200484f-4f29-7694-9fe6-58ca0d039d74
Eric Gray,"Decisive, creative runner with the size and skill set for three-down consideration on the pro level. Gray won‚Äôt be a home run hitter in the open field, but his short-area burst and oily hips open access to the entire field, with cuts coming suddenly and at unpredictable angles. He‚Äôs a less powerful finisher than his size might indicate and needs to keep from spilling runs wide unnecessarily. He is a reliable threat out of the backfield with soft hands and a willingness to block. Gray has the potential to find work quickly as a three-down backup with future starter potential.",6.22,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eric-gray/32004752-4165-2870-85bd-e1a472b80efc
Elijah Higgins,"Draft grades for Higgins could vary depending on how teams envision using him in their offense. While teams might see him as a big possession receiver with limitations, he appears to have the necessary tools to become a dynamic F tight end with the ability to work all three levels of the field. Higgins has average ball skills but can run a more robust route tree than most tight ends. Also, he has the frame and technique to be an adequate run blocker in space. He might never be more than a backup at receiver but could blossom for an offense ready to plug him into two tight end sets.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/elijah-higgins/32004849-4713-8430-181a-e629ca4da181
Jartavius Martin,"Versatile cornerback/safety prospect with the size and physical talent to play nickel back or align as a deep safety. A buttery smooth hip swivel allows him to glide and transition effectively from his pedal, but he has just average route recognition to stay connected to clever route runners. Martin‚Äôs speed and explosiveness at the NFL Scouting Combine was eye-catching, but he needs to play consistently to that speed on the field. A team will need to decide where to play him, but he has the potential to become an early contributor and a starter further down the road.",6.22,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jartavius-martin/32004d41-5264-5121-58ce-d7c1593339a8
Isaiah McGuire,"An edge defender with good size and length, McGuire‚Äôs flashes of power and disruption might allow for a projection beyond what you would expect for his somewhat inconsistent tape. He struggles to hold his ground against edge blocks. His B-gap freestyles bring tackles for loss, but they also allow for massive run lanes. He‚Äôs a bulldozing power rusher who can uproot tackles and collapse pockets with forceful punch and explosive leg drive. He‚Äôll need to get schooled up on varying his entry points and angles to keep NFL tackles guessing, but his style should translate in the league. His run defense needs work, but his size and disruption could make him a starter one day.",6.22,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-mcguire/32004d43-4779-4607-f244-3b54d3888de4
Tyjae Spears,"Spears has the size of a change-of-pace back, but he needs to play with more consistent explosiveness, as he‚Äôs unlikely to offer the versatility typically expected from a player in that role. He‚Äôs coming off an extremely productive and consistent season as Tulane‚Äôs RB1, though. He runs with good bend, average vision and the patience to use lead blockers to his advantage. Spears possesses modest creativity and power through the line of scrimmage but becomes more elusive once he‚Äôs up to the second level.",6.22,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyjae-spears/32005350-4511-3961-6914-5e32243e62c5
Ricky Stromberg,"Center prospect with enough athleticism and strength to be considered scheme independent. Early impressions could leave evaluators unimpressed with his lack of control at times; however, his process and results should quickly grow on them. Stromberg generates decent movement at the point of attack and is well-schooled with landmarks as a zone blocker. His waist-bending causes inconsistencies with his mirror and recoveries in protection. He has an innate feel for angles and positioning that leads to some unexpected block wins. Stromberg has a chance to become a starting center with the flexibility to play guard if needed.",6.22,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ricky-stromberg/32005354-5260-5750-52b2-dda533841893
KJ Henry,"Highly athletic edge defender with good size. Henry has upfield burst, but he tends to be a face-up rusher and will need to improve his hand usage for more effective corner turns. He can be dynamic when twisting and blitzing as a moveable piece around the defensive front and he does a nice job of setting up a buttery smooth inside rush that is often too quick for tackles. He can dart and disrupt as a one-gapper with his hand in the ground but has more trouble than expected in setting firm edges as a run defender. Henry‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses are well-defined, with the upside to become a starter.",6.21,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kj-henry/32004845-4e62-4398-758e-3f565d3dc34c
Brenton Strange,"H-back option with a compact frame and a nice blend of athleticism and toughness to fuel his game. Strange gets after it as a lead blocker, in-line or in space. There are technique issues that need to be ironed out, but the demeanor and play strength are where they need to be to succeed. While his catch production is pedestrian, he‚Äôs athletic in his routes and is an above-average runner after the catch. In a draft filled with high-quality tight end talent, Strange could fly under the radar as a future starter with the potential to operate as a hybrid, three-down talent.",6.21,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brenton-strange/32005354-5218-8631-c965-3e23bcc23565
Jack Campbell,"Inside linebacker who is built for the box and plays with good overall physicality. Campbell‚Äôs size allows him to challenge blocks and stand his ground despite inconsistent hand usage at the take-on point. He scrapes and plugs his run fits with workmanlike dependability but lacks the short-area burst and reactive athleticism teams typically look for from NFL starters. He plays with above-average field awareness. He‚Äôs capable as a zone defender and in some matchups against in-line tight ends. What you see is what you get with Campbell, and teams will need to balance the consistency with the playmaking limitations in their evaluations.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jack-campbell/32004341-4d36-4731-433d-b35acfc680bc
Daiyan Henley,"A rambunctious inside linebacker with good speed and toughness, Henley‚Äôs playing style can be described as more active than instinctive. His inconsistency in reading keys and anticipating the play flow is mitigated somewhat by his speed and talent to wrap and finish in space. He has excellent range and does a nice job of stepping downhill to challenge blockers and running lanes. There are some eye-catching production totals in the takeaway column and favorable physical elements to his game, but inefficient movement combined with recognition delays could push him toward a backup and core special teams role in the future.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daiyan-henley/32004845-4e46-6212-4f0a-603906125b28
Nick Herbig,"A three-year starter as a 3-4 outside linebacker, Herbig is lacking in size and strength but possesses plenty of athleticism and potential. He can be a slippery rusher with subtle hands and a wicked inside move that leaves tackles in the mud. His lack of play strength limits his speed-to-power rush and his ability to stand his ground against tackles looking to widen him off the mark. He would benefit from a year in the weight room to get ready for NFL edge work, but he might have the instincts and athletic ability for consideration as an off-ball linebacker.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-herbig/32004845-5204-2107-989b-b9a0ebf10845
Mike Morris,"We won‚Äôt dismiss the production, size or the athleticism Morris shows on tape, but his disappointing NFL Scouting Combine testing should force teams to reevaluate him. He needs to crank up his intensity on a more regular basis, but his ability to take on blockers and create advantages flashes in every game. His run defense will trend ahead of the pass rush until he becomes more skilled with his hands and at creating angles of entry. Morris could have the versatility to play in odd or even fronts, but it might take a couple of years for him to hit his stride.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-morris/32004d4f-5248-0831-1322-2ec4ee6accb4
Luke Wypler,"Two-year starter at center for an explosive Ohio State offense. Wypler is undersized but highly athletic. His initial quickness gets him to the best angles, whether he‚Äôs cutting off linebackers or reaching and sealing outside zone blocks. He‚Äôs capable of pulling and leading the action in space, and is best suited for a move-based running attack. His lack of size and length will show up when working downhill, where struggles to sustain. He‚Äôs aware in pass protection but big bull rushers are a cause for concern. Wypler is a good technician and capable of becoming an average starter in the right scheme.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/luke-wypler/32005759-5041-5291-5926-68b1220e1610
Byron Young,"An explosive edge defender with disruptive play qualities, Young is still in the process of learning how to play his position. His rush hands lack skill and he‚Äôs missing go-to counters, but that could be coachable for him. He creates chaos when using his twitchy first step to slant and twist but still needs to tune up the stack-and-shed technique and build out a cohesive rush approach. He will be a 25-year-old rookie with a lack of polish for his age, which could be a deterrent for some teams, but a fully fueled motor and strong desire to make plays on the other side of the line of scrimmage give him a shot to become a capable pro.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/byron-young/3200594f-5512-7040-ee4b-f8bc5d0b4a6e
Cameron Young,"Naturally powerful prospect who is able to take on capable challengers and come out in good shape despite playing with an elevated pad level. Young plays with early hands and a heavy punch to gain positioning quickly against single blocks. He has the core power and contact balance to force double teams to work. Also, he does a nice job of fighting against wash-down blocks and maintaining gap integrity against zone. He has the size, length and strength to become a proficient run defender but offers very little as a pass rusher. While Young will be seen as a natural nose tackle, he could see snaps as a 5-technique as well.",6.2,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-young/3200594f-5512-8406-fbe2-6ad8024c21b6
Davis Allen,"There is nothing particularly exciting about watching Allen get into and through his routes, but the magic happens once the ball goes up. Allen is a human vacuum, using instinctive body positioning, mid-air adjustments and exceptional catch focus for consistent 50/50 wins. He isn‚Äôt much of a route separator, but he secures a high number of contested throws. The blocking technique is good, but the size and strength are just OK by NFL standards for in-line tight ends. Allen‚Äôs success will be determined by his ability to improve his routes or find a scheme that can free him to do his thing as a pass-catcher.",6.19,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/davis-allen/3200414c-4c09-8299-f00f-278951746672
Anthony Bradford,"Massive, scheme-specific guard prospect with plus power but obvious athletic limitations. Bradford has functional quickness as a pulling guard and can work from one block to the next with adequate timing. He can be effective as a single blocker but really shines on double teams, where he can help clear the pathway. His lack of lateral quickness and reactive athleticism can put him in a bind against one-gapping defensive tackles and sub-package rushers with short-area twitch. Bradford has the potential to become an eventual starter for gap and power teams.",6.19,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-bradford/32004252-4109-4410-68c8-affa4c115558
Keondre Coburn,"A stout but athletic nose tackle with nimble feet, Coburn can sit down and muddy run lanes or create difficulties for pin-and-pull blocking schemes with his interior agility. While he‚Äôs not a three-down lineman, he does have the bull rush and activity level to cause issues as a rusher. He‚Äôs more than capable of pressing and separating from blocks as a two-gapping plugger but requires more consistent technique to improve his consistency in that area. Coburn‚Äôs blend of girth, power and agility could be coveted by teams looking for help along the interior.",6.19,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keondre-coburn/3200434f-4282-3710-d7b1-7bab7fe764f1
DeWayne McBride,"Productive runner with the physical/athletic attributes that could create an upward trajectory in the right situation. McBride is experienced and comfortable running in all blocking schemes. He‚Äôs smooth-hipped and runs with a good blend of shiftiness, and power. He would benefit from a quicker tempo and decisiveness inside. He must eliminate ball security issues or he could end up falling out of favor quickly. McBride‚Äôs lack of third down value could hurt his draft slotting, but his upside is worth a Day 3 selection.",6.19,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dewayne-mcbride/32004d43-4237-3490-bbda-1ea9d60ee72b
Olu Oluwatimi,"Four-year starter and highly decorated player who was part of a unit that won the Joe Moore Award (best offensive line in college football) in consecutive years. Oluwatimi benefited from tight splits and a scheme designed to take advantage of double teams up front. He will bend a little at the waist, but displays good technique on double teams and generates decent drive on base blocks. He lacks the lateral quickness needed for range as a run blocker and must learn to better recognize and respond to twists in pass protection. Oluwatimi has future starting potential but could struggle in a scheme that forces him to play in space.",6.19,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/olu-oluwatimi/32004f4c-5559-3274-eef4-acb200e9e905
Garrett Williams,"Outside cornerback with the footwork/athleticism to match routes with good balance and smooth transitions. Williams possesses average size but can be a willing tackler when the opportunity arises. He can mirror and match the release but is inconsistent playing with his back to the quarterback. On the flip side, he‚Äôs instinctive and twitchy from zone and off-man but must become more aggressive at attacking passing lanes rather than playing the man. He suffered an ACL tear in October 2022, but if his pre-draft medical exams check out, he could go in the middle rounds and have a chance to become a CB3.",6.19,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garrett-williams/32005749-4c29-2135-4337-7403b68fd2b1
Karl Brooks,"The inclination to shrug off Brooks‚Äô production based on level of competition -- or because of questions about his positional fit -- might be a mistake. Brooks‚Äô snap quickness, footwork, hand usage and motor are all translatable play qualities. His movement and counters are intuitive, allowing for quick access into the backfield. Against the pass, he frequently beat tackles as a bull rusher off the edge. Brooks has the size of a three-technique but the versatility and athleticism to move around a defensive front. He flashes disruptive, three-down talent as a future starter in a one-gap scheme.",6.18,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/karl-brooks/32004252-4f13-2842-c7f3-69c8ea1b4c30
Anthony Johnson Jr.,"Cornerback turned safety with good athletic traits for the safety position and rare physicality from a former cornerback. Johnson has grown into a safety‚Äôs frame but is versatile enough to play near the line of scrimmage or line up over the slot. He moves fluidly with good play speed but is still processing angles and coverage responsibilities at his new position. He will come downhill and hit anything near the line of scrimmage with everything he‚Äôs got, but he needs to learn to control his aggression to become a more consistent tackler. Johnson‚Äôs traits, versatility and toughness give him a chance to become a starting safety or nickel safety.",6.18,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-johnson-jr/32004a4f-4878-9936-25b4-d6b1428e60fb
Tyler Lacy,"Lacy is usually first with his hands but needs to learn to jolt opponents and control the block more consistently with them. His block take-on can be a little bit segmented and he can be driven off his turf as a three-technique, but he has the length and athleticism to cause disruption in a one-gapping scheme. Lacy has talent as an interior rusher but might be better suited as a five-technique or 4-3 base end on early downs.",6.18,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-lacy/32004c41-4373-5924-5235-33d4f397e955
Sam LaPorta,"Highly targeted tight end whose playing style and physical abilities land somewhere between a connected (in-line or wing) and move tight end. LaPorta has the ability to threaten zone coverage and will make the basic catches. However, he lacks the desired elusiveness and ball skills to come away with the more challenging catches. LaPorta takes on run-blocking chores with inconsistent positioning but has the potential to improve with more work in that phase of the game. His catch production is splashy, but he appears to have average-starter potential at the next level.",6.18,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sam-laporta/32004c41-5064-0235-3970-b5e5514839fc
Tavius Robinson,"Ascending, even-front defensive end prospect with outstanding traits and projectable upside. Robinson plays with good aggression and heavy hands as both a run defender and pass rusher. He has the agility and foot quickness to beat blockers whether chasing the run or rushing the passer. Robinson attacks the pocket with a game plan and a variety of moves at his disposal. He needs to grow into his frame to improve against the run, but Robinson should become a rotational defender and has future-starter potential.",6.18,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tavius-robinson/3200524f-4270-5359-8394-0a4c379677b7
Jay Ward,"Versatile defensive back with a fearless playing mentality. Ward has good size and length for a nickel cornerback, but he lacks a little thickness as a safety who likes to hit. He can be counted on to do his job in run support from the slot and has adequate coverage talent from off-man and zone. He will make plays when he‚Äôs in position to do so but doesn‚Äôt have the route anticipation needed for strong on-ball production just yet. Ward takes good angles to the football in coverage and run support as a safety. His versatility improves his chances of becoming an NFL starter in the future.",6.18,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jay-ward/32005741-5219-9835-c33b-128fd1cf5673
Charlie Jones,"Exceptionally productive in his season at Purdue after transferring from Iowa, Jones will have trouble shedding tight, press-man coverage due to his lack of suddenness and blow-by speed. He possesses above average ball skills and has a feel for positioning and focus that creates a solid win rate on his contested catches. He can play zone-beater all day long and has the route savvy to keep improving his short-area separation. Jones is unlikely to work the deepest portions of the field but might find work in a possession-based passing game as a Day 3 draft pick.",6.17,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charlie-jones/32004a4f-4e16-0287-5859-a7165d1cc115
Jordan McFadden,"Three-year starter and team captain with experience at both tackle spots. McFadden lacks the height/length to stay at tackle in the NFL, but he has the broad frame and run-blocking acumen to fit as a guard. He‚Äôs firm and accurate into blocks using good footwork to drive and turn opponents. He lacks ideal mass and will get dumped by twitchy run defenders at times. His protection experience at tackle is a big plus in his favor, but he still needs to fire his hands with better efficiency and from a tighter track. McFadden is a reliable prospect lacking desired measurables but has the chance to become a good backup with eventual starter potential.",6.17,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-mcfadden/32004d43-4611-2355-9a4f-ced5087b9648
Kayshon Boutte,"Boutte‚Äôs size, speed and flashes over his first two seasons could be enough to override a very uneven 2022. He has inside/outside value and can be just as adept at uncovering underneath as he can at stretching the field. He ran simple routes at LSU but has the athletic ability to expand on that with more attention to detail. The ball skills are a little disappointing, with too many drops showing up on tape. He‚Äôs talented with the ball in his hands and has playmaking potential if he reverts to his previous form. Boutte could work his way into an eventual WR2/3 role barring any further issues with his right ankle.",6.1,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kayshon-boutte/3200424f-5548-2823-b93f-32f7b68b0dd3
Mohamed Ibrahim,"Hard-hat running back who operated with toughness, vision and a feel for cut timing in the Minnesota inside/outside zone attack. Ibrahim‚Äôs decisiveness stands out, but he‚Äôs missing an elevated burst to clear second-level tacklers without taking bumps and bruises. He‚Äôs not going to run away from NFL defenders, so creativity will be important to keep runs alive. His injury history, paired with his combative running style, could be a concern for some teams, but his no-nonsense running approach and innate feel for the end zone will be easy for coaches to love.",6.16,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mohamed-ibrahim/32004942-5241-5291-eca7-0674e7b15d15
CJ Johnson,"It‚Äôs easy to look at the lack of route separation/play speed and question whether Johnson can be anything more than a zone beater in the NFL, but that evaluation misses a lot. Johnson might see more contested catches than you would prefer, but he‚Äôs also built to win them. He‚Äôs physically strong and plays to his size while utilizing very natural ball skills to beat opponents to the football. He‚Äôs often forced out of bounds as a runner because tacklers struggle to bring him down. Johnson is a possession slot receiver in need of better route running. His tools and competitiveness will give him an advantage in a battle for a WR3/WR4 spot.",6.16,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cj-johnson/32004a4f-4813-2702-93ac-8367591ef55b
Henry To'oTo'o,Assignment-oriented linebacker whose play is steady but unspectacular. To‚ÄôoTo‚Äôo is tough but lacks thump inside and doesn‚Äôt have the speed to cut off angles and stop outside run plays before they get to the corner. He‚Äôs a good technician but his play is a little more conservative than it will need to be with relatively average traits. To‚ÄôoTo‚Äôo is always under control and generally where he needs to be. He‚Äôs just average in coverage and will need to become much more consistent as an open-field tackler. Good backup to below-average starter could be his career path whether he plays inside or outside.,6.16,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henry-to-oto-o/3200544f-4f67-5714-6435-02b19e1c75f0
Carter Warren,"Warren possesses the size and length that teams are looking for from the tackle position. He plays too upright, which diminishes his effectiveness as a move blocker and in pass protection, but he‚Äôs capable in both areas. He can discombobulate pass rushers with well-timed, independent hands that help maximize his length with punching. He can be tardy sliding his feet into position as a run blocker and in protection, which can lead to holding and a lack of power to redirect. He‚Äôs a better pass protector than run blocker at this stage, but he could hear his name called in the middle rounds with a chance to become a swing tackle or low-end starter in the future.",6.16,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carter-warren/32005741-5258-0333-38bb-413be1b8a9fd
Tank Bigsby,"Bigsby is an upright runner with a strong, angular frame. He runs with plus burst and can create yards even when the blocking is insufficient. Bigsby runs with a nice blend of elusiveness and power, and he can quickly process movements of the defense. Fumbling has been a concern in the past, and he might not be much help on third downs or special teams. His size, creativity and quickness could create an opportunity for teams to pair Bigsby with another back to form an effective tandem in a zone-scheme rushing attack.",6.15,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tank-bigsby/32004249-4773-2544-d042-8e63f2fc44d8
Tre'Vius Hodges-Tomlinson,"Hodges-Tomlinson possesses the athletic profile and ball production to become a starting nickel back. He uses aggression and explosiveness to help overcome his size deficiency. He‚Äôs twitchy and sudden to press and hound receivers underneath. However, he needs to trust his technique instead of defaulting to excessive crowding and hand-fighting that turns into penalties. He‚Äôs fully accepting of his run-support responsibilities and is generally solid in that area. Hodges-Tomlinson will face occasional size mismatches, but he‚Äôs more than capable of holding his own over the course of a season.",6.15,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-vius-hodges-tomlinson/3200484f-4451-3203-eff4-45c2feb76163
Asim Richards,"Richards is thick-hipped with good lower-body power fueling above average drive-blocking potential. He clears space when he‚Äôs centered into opponents, but he lacks the body control and hand consistency to do so on a regular basis. Pass protection concerns will be diminished with a move inside, but there will still be work needed when it comes to getting his feet in position to slow interior rushers. Richards‚Äô drive blocking and potential position versatility give him a shot at a backup role with upside.",6.15,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/asim-richards/32005249-4321-9051-d704-8eaedee89bd1
Kobie Turner,"Turner will be an interesting litmus test for how much teams value tape and production versus traits and athleticism. He‚Äôs extremely powerful, with the ability to jolt opponents with heavy hands, and he's infrequently beaten and sustained by single blockers. He lacks ideal mass and length, has trouble holding his ground against double teams and might find it tougher to disengage from NFL blockers, due to his lack of length. However, motor, determination, toughness and strength fuel Turner‚Äôs inevitable forward progress as both a run defender and pass-rush irritant, despite his lack of NFL measurables. He should become a talented rotational defender with a chance to do more.",6.15,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kobie-turner/32005455-5256-1805-792f-d5a6d13c60e4
Braeden Daniels,"Active, athletic offensive lineman offering room for development at guard or tackle. Daniels is an impactful down blocker with the quickness to handle zone-blocking duties. Firing out and sustaining drive blocks, however, will require much better patience and footwork to keep from whiffing or falling off blocks. Small hands prevent him from latching in as a run blocker or in pass protection, but flurrying hands and a tenacious mirror help him stay in front of rushers. Position versatility and correctable issues could raise Daniels‚Äô draft profile as a middle-rounder with upside.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/braeden-daniels/32004441-4e44-1069-c84d-edc94fccf74d
Blake Freeland,"A sky-scraping tackle prospect with outstanding length and good fluidity, Freeland should get much stronger with time in an NFL weight room. He is an effort-based run blocker who has to really crank up the work rate and technique to try to overcome his leverage disadvantages due to his height. He plays with decent technique in protection and does a nice job of battling through adversity inside the rep. However, he might lack the bend and range to get out and redirect speedy edge-benders. Freeland is an unfinished product with a modest ceiling as a pro.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/blake-freeland/32004652-4513-5054-76d3-d5e67ccd9902
DJ Johnson,"Power merchant with jarring initial hand strikes that can create early advantages. Johnson is big, explosive and rugged but lacking the experience and technique to consistently capitalize on his physicality. He has broad, tight hips that make it challenging to keep the pad level where it needs to be as a rusher, tackler and while taking on run blocks. He has very few moves or counters, but his bull rush can put opponents on skates. There is significant technique work that needs to take place, but his NFL Scouting Combine testing should only help his draft stock.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dj-johnson/32004a4f-4820-4752-6ea6-b2eea911de03
Lonnie Phelps,"Built for work as a 3-4 outside linebacker with very average size but above average athletic traits and field toughness. Phelps plays with an attacking demeanor and reckless abandon to make it hard for tackles to keep up with his energy for four quarters. He‚Äôs explosive and bendy, with the ability to flatten and close to the quarterback. However, he needs to improve his hand usage and technique both as a pass rusher and run defender. Phelps is a demon on special teams and possesses the qualities to become a very good rotational edge defender with a ceiling that has room for growth.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lonnie-phelps/32005048-4557-7804-1d84-5ea439b76d50
Cory Trice Jr.,"While he has legitimate strong safety size, Trice‚Äôs game is better suited for the cornerback position. He is physical in coverage but lacks the same temperament in run support. His size and strength help impede the early stages of a route and smother possession throws underneath. He‚Äôs a decent athlete but lacks ideal fluidity and speed to recover when beaten, so press and zone coverages are where he should live. While there are limitations, there is also room for technical growth to make him a better pro. He won‚Äôt be for everyone, but teams valuing size over speed will covet him as a middle-round pick with upside.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cory-trice-jr/32005452-4903-4803-21b4-7e6c2e8c1619
Josh Whyle,"Smooth, athletic pass-catcher with the competitiveness to battle for playing time in the league. Whyle is an average route runner who is forced to tap the brakes when facing physical coverage, but he has the tools to uncover as a pro. He possesses the jump-ball prowess to mismatch defensive backs near the goal line and can be a nice safety blanket on pitch-and-catch throws underneath. He needs to keep adding play strength to match the rigors of the position and is better suited as a move blocker than tenacious in-line blocker near the line of scrimmage. Whyle appears to be a middle-round prospect for teams seeking an F tight end or H-back with starting upside.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-whyle/32005748-5920-7645-1b1b-72fa42df9b82
Colby Wooden,"Defensive line prospect whose steady weight gain and frame development have allowed him to see the game at a variety of alignments. Wooden is at his most disruptive when attacking from the interior. He has a quick first step to attack gaps and threaten the pocket, but he‚Äôs unable to sit down and drop a deep anchor against bullies in the run game. Wooden‚Äôs activity level and hand skill are the keys to his current and future success -- they allow him to keep pressure on blockers from snap to whistle. High football character and scheme versatility work in Wooden's favor, but he will need to find the right team fit.",6.14,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/colby-wooden/3200574f-4f26-8652-9840-d4ab2bec1889
Yasir Abdullah,"Teams will need to decide whether to play him as a 3-4 rusher or try him as an off-ball linebacker in a 4-3 defense. One look at the size and length will turn most 3-4 teams off, but the tape tells a different story. His leverage, power and agility mitigate size issues, while his nose for the football has created production as a run defender, pass rusher and special teams tackler. He‚Äôs not a fluid mover, but he‚Äôs hardly stiff and is always near the play. The rush production might not be translatable on the next level, but Abdullah has the talent and tenacity to become a solid pro who can play immediately on special teams.",6.13,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/yasir-abdullah/32004142-4468-5761-697c-5797029c343f
Eku Leota,"Leota is the definition of a 3-4 strong side outside linebacker. He offers the toughness/strength to do battle and hold the fort along the edge. He plays with the same effort and aggression on every snap. Leota has above average skill level when taking on tackles and tight ends. His rush attack lacks a robust skill set and production might be based upon scheme, and secondary effort, in many instances. Leota has a chance to develop into a plus run defender and potential starter as a 3-4 edge defender.",6.13,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eku-leota/32004c45-4f77-2615-e3d6-a2255f6293d2
Tyler Steen,"Steen began his career as a defensive tackle at Vanderbilt and ended it as a starting left tackle at Alabama. He‚Äôs a vertical pass-setter who plays with good awareness to twists and blitzes. Steen uses length and hand resets to extend his mirroring. He would benefit from better catch-and-clamp hands to limit secondary rush opportunities. He plays with hustle off the snap to find back-side positioning on zone blocks, but he needs to eliminate his forward lean in space to improve timing and adjustments at the second level. Steen has good size with average athleticism and is still fine-tuning technique. He could compete for a role as a swing backup early on but could find starting snaps in time.",6.13,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-steen/32005354-4509-7919-ee71-a091da3c2fad
Adetomiwa Adebawore,"Adebawore seems like a positional tweener, checking in a little short for the edge and a little light for the interior. However, he was able to handle himself at the point of attack at the Senior Bowl and is just a few hearty meals away from checking in at a weight that could pass for an even front three-technique. He‚Äôs a powerful man who wins with force over fluidity. He will need better play recognition in the future, but his explosive first contact and ability to play under his opponent‚Äôs pads could earn him a spot as a base end with sub-package rush ability or simply as a rotational interior defender.",6.12,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/adetomiwa-adebawore/32004144-4502-1468-3d33-a0f9da804e5c
Chase Brown,Volume ball-carrier with a compact frame and high-end stamina to wear defenses down. Brown is less slasher than he is a between-the-tackles grinder. He needs to prove he can be an effective outside runner to help widen the field. He‚Äôs natural and agile as a one-cut runner and has the receiving talent to make plays out of the backfield. He‚Äôs a bit of a one-note runner but could compete for a three-down backup role with a limited ceiling.,6.12,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chase-brown/32004252-4f34-0581-a205-5f41836f80e9
Riley Moss,"An instinctive cornerback with good size and play strength, Moss will need to prove he has the speed and durability needed for the next level. He has issues recovering quickly when beaten from press or at route breaks. Ballhawking instincts and soft hands are a big part of his game, as is his physicality at the catch point and as a tackler. He has CB3/4 potential in a zone-based defense, but could find reps at safety in the future if a team believes he has the frame for it.",6.12,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/riley-moss/32004d4f-5370-9340-14ef-a2c9b70519a7
Eli Ricks,"A long-limbed cornerback with an impressive physical profile, Ricks is in need of more experience to sharpen his skills and recognition. He is a press-man cornerback with a relatively smooth pedal and an ability to push and punch receivers with accuracy from long distance. He‚Äôs often a step slow to find top gear when opening to run laterally or vertically, but he‚Äôs a human blanket against short and intermediate routes without much wiggle to them. Ricks needs to be more assertive against the run and could struggle on an island, but his traits and press talent should fit in the right scheme.",6.12,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eli-ricks/32005249-4379-4760-4f27-74b926f1e43c
Darius Rush,"Two-year starter at cornerback after moving from wide receiver in his redshirt freshman season. Rush is big, long and physical. He struggles to stay connected with routes from both press and off coverages but could improve with more technique work. He will never have the short area foot quickness to mirror and match routes but has impressive ball skills to disrupt the catch when he‚Äôs in position.",6.12,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darius-rush/32005255-5305-7910-a1a9-d9de1ee2cde8
Arquon Bush,"Outside cornerback with good size and above average footwork and recognition for pattern matching. Bush lacks top-end speed and plays off-man coverage to protect himself, but it allows for far too many catches underneath. He has twitchy, agile feet with the potential to squeeze the top of the route more effectively if given safety help. Bush‚Äôs instincts and ball skills give him a chance to be a middle-round pick as a zone or off-man corner.",6.11,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/arquon-bush/32004255-5318-9053-14c9-b023c76d6365
Jammie Robinson,"Short-armed defensive back with good toughness, a compact frame and the versatility for consideration at nickel back or safety. He thrives when playing downhill, where anticipation and burst provide quick closure to make plays on the throw. He has twitchy feet to match up from the slot but tends to stay behind if he falls behind in the route. He‚Äôs a run supporter with a nose for the ball but average stopping power. Robinson lacks ideal measurables and was unimpressive in NFL Scouting Combine athletic testing, but he‚Äôs a feisty defender whose success could be determined by how a team decides to deploy him.",6.11,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jammie-robinson/3200524f-4252-6445-4e6b-4353e5a8fc4d
Cameron Latu,"High-hipped pass-catching tight end with run blocking fortitude to mold. Latu‚Äôs lean legs and angular frame aren‚Äôt made for drive blocking or neutralizing bigger players, but he does a nice job of sustaining move blocks in space. He changes route speed to open throwing windows over the first two levels. There are some issues with focus drops at times, but he plucks throws with good hand extension when possible. Latu could have roster appeal as an F tight end with an average ceiling.",6.1,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-latu/32004c41-5471-8773-4cf1-b41246d16b16
Nick Saldiveri,"Three-year starter with good overall size/length and the potential to play multiple spots along the offensive line. Saldiveri is naturally athletic and should fit best as a zone blocker or pulling guard who can get out into space and find work. Hand skill and placement are consistent issues on tape and could prevent him from neutralizing NFL opposition at a functional level. If he proves he can snap the ball and makes a move to center, that should improve his draft stock and give him a better chance as a pro.",6.1,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-saldiveri/32005341-4c23-6049-3b39-0b592fdccc0b
Tre Tucker,"Tucker‚Äôs slight frame and short arms work against him, but his speed and quickness give him the ability to uncover on all three levels. He‚Äôs going to struggle to make contested catches, whether it‚Äôs a defender or the ground doing the contesting. While he can stretch the field, he might be most effective as a possession target underneath and gadget option capable of making plays with the ball in his hands. His specific attributes create a higher ceiling but lower floor as a pro.",6.11,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-tucker/32005455-4339-9910-7816-4a6883d99032
Jeremy Banks,"Inside linebacker who makes up for being slightly undersized with physicality. Banks' instincts and recognition improved in 2022, but he can still get better in those areas. He plays with below-average short-area twitch and just modest pursuit speed from sideline to sideline but will hit and wrap what is in front of him. He‚Äôs a likely two-down backup who might come off the field on passing downs but run back out for special teams reps.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-banks/32004241-4e55-7651-ef1e-5ba929855536
Andre Carter II,"Long and rangy, Carter is currently best suited as a 3-4 rush linebacker on passing downs, but is likely to develop into an every-down player with additional growth both physically and technically. Carter needs to play with more skilled hands and inject a little more glass into his on-field diet in order to meet force with force when the run game comes downhill at him. His explosive get-off and natural bend/agility at the top of the rush are enough to create early opportunities for himself as a quarterback hunter. Carter might need a longer runway to meet his potential, but if does his pass-rush homework, he could take a substantial leap forward as an odd or even front edge rusher by Year 3.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-carter-ii/32004341-5278-7212-1841-9ebe43127662
McClendon Curtis,"Guard prospect with the build of a long-armed offensive tackle. Despite his traits, Curtis has too many holes in his game to trust he will be ready to step up in competition early on. His struggles in trying to separate and sustain against Illinois‚Äô interior defenders really shined a bright light on the work he needs to do to get stronger and more technically sound. Despite these concerns, Curtis is capable in pocket protection and is likely to be viewed as a Day 3 prospect requiring a plan and coaching to help him develop.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mcclendon-curtis/32004355-5267-7287-57b1-b2dca6786cfc
Gervon Dexter Sr.,"Dexter is frequently slow off snap, which tends to have a domino effect on both his hands and positioning in a negative way. His size and traits help him make plays even after being blocked early in the rep, but he will need to improve his hand usage as a pro. He‚Äôs a limited pass rusher with below average quickness and rush skill but can get there eventually if the play extends. Dexter‚Äôs physical profile might be hard for teams to ignore, and he could become a more consistent performer in a 3-4 defense.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gervon-dexter-sr/32004445-5863-4187-6630-33b3a986f697
Jaelyn Duncan,"Highly athletic four-year starter at left tackle who might have the best chance to stick in the league as a zone-scheme guard. It‚Äôs easy to love the athletic flashes, but it‚Äôs challenging to love the complete body of work when studying the game tape. Duncan rarely plays with enough finish and his man is frequently near the final action because of it. He has the foot speed to protect as a left tackle, but his ability to anchor is a major concern. His lateral quickness should work to his advantage as a move blocker, but he‚Äôll need to unearth enough grit to stand up to NFL bullies at the point of attack to make it.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaelyn-duncan/32004455-4e20-7641-895f-3afbdd2077a5
Kahlef Hailassie,"Hailassie has the size, instincts and ball skills to surprise on the next level. His route anticipation and ability to sniff out the quarterback‚Äôs intentions serve him well in zone, which might be the best fit for him. However, unlike many zone corners, he has the mirror-and-match pedal and smooth hips to stay connected to routes. He‚Äôs tough as a run defender but needs to prove he can play against NFL competition across from him. Hailassie has Day 3 potential and is a prospect to watch.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kahlef-hailassie/32004841-4918-7052-280f-70a8e10d3657
Nick Hampton,"Undersized 3-4 outside linebacker who might require a game plan from his drafting team due to the strengths and weaknesses of his frame and his game. Hampton isn‚Äôt anything special as a run defender, but his pass-rush tape really stands out. He‚Äôs an explosive, linear pass rusher featuring subtle techniques near the top of the rush that help him access the pocket. Hampton will be a strong tester but finding a clean positional fit could be a challenge. At worst, he could find snaps as a full-time special-teamer and backup linebacker with pass-rush talent.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-hampton/32004841-4d76-7654-4dc6-0d8b2ebb3bf9
Darrell Luter Jr.,"Long-limbed press-cover cornerback with the ball skills and physicality to challenge receivers outside the numbers. Luter can be a little leggy in his transitions and burst to the football, but his length helps make up for that and creates pass breakups. Louisiana-Monroe attacked him with back-shoulder throws all game, which is something to keep an eye on in the pros. He‚Äôs going to be more effective in press-and-shadow coverage than he is playing Cover 3 or off-man. His ball production dipped in 2022, but his length and playing style fit the NFL game.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrell-luter-jr/32004c55-5413-8430-ddc4-b737661964cf
Atonio Mafi,"With a wide frame that can be challenging to navigate for run defenders, Mafi plays with good core strength, a broad base and well-placed hands to improve his power zone. Move blocking in the ground game and reactive adjustments in pass protection will create difficulties for him due to a lack of foot quickness. He plays with a chippy temperament that coaches will like. Mafi is scheme-dependent, but he has the potential to be a good backup or low-end starter.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/atonio-mafi/32004d41-4642-6541-262e-e21e92feefa6
Warren McClendon Jr.,"A three-year starter and two-time national champion, McClendon has been a hardworking team leader at Georgia. His intangibles, however, are countered by a lack of ideal size, length and athleticism as either a tackle or a guard. McClendon needs to get stronger and will always have issues finding success too far away from home base, but he works to the whistle and has enough pass protection savvy for multi-positional consideration as a backup.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/warren-mcclendon-jr/32004d43-4339-6909-f80c-dc33061d9216
Wanya Morris,Morris is an athletic pass-setter with a strong inside hand but lacks a desired level of core strength to effectively push back against rush bullies. He‚Äôs very average at getting to positioning for back-side cut-off blocks in the run game and struggles to stay connected to sustain blocks due to inconsistent hand placement and drive strength in his lower half. His physical profile and experience starting at both tackle spots should give him a leg up in a camp battle for a swing tackle role.,6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/wanya-morris/32004d4f-5255-2993-1877-6a7e9fa606f3
Jose Ramirez,"Ramirez‚Äôs below-average run defense could make it difficult for him to see the field early in his career, but he blends a hot motor and natural rush talent that could entice teams willing to continue his development in both phases. He‚Äôs agile with the ability to gather and chase with quickness once he finds an advantage inside the pocket. He can add strength and technique to improve his block take-on, but he'll also need to show more grit. Ramirez has the potential to be drafted later on Day 3; natural pass rushers always have a shot to grow and become productive pros.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jose-ramirez/32005241-4d05-7102-fab5-8bc5fe1d71a1
Rashee Rice,"Talented but enigmatic receiver with game tape that shows a lack of consistency and impressive ball skills. Rice has enough top-end speed to attack vertically but has a tendency for nonchalant running on intermediate routes and zone-beaters underneath. In one game you might see terrific ball-tracking and jump-ball victories followed by frustrating drops and a lack of physicality in fighting back on contested catches. The route inefficiencies can be cleaned up, but Rice must play with better consistency and urgency to find long-term NFL reps.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashee-rice/32005249-4315-2916-ce74-9a69e469f940
Juice Scruggs,"A two-year starter with center/guard versatility, Scruggs is dependable and consistent in carrying out his assignment to the best of his ability. He plays like a block of granite that is difficult to push back or knock off-balance, but he‚Äôs more of a neutralizer than road grader. He plays with solid technique and possesses the play strength to hold his own in the middle. The lack of foot quickness shows up with athletic defenders leaking around his edges and that issue could be exacerbated if teams play him at guard. Scruggs has the potential to go from backup to eventual starter if the situation is right.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/juice-scruggs/32005343-5267-3400-4cb9-0ed0b61b2e6f
Justin Shorter,"Big and long with the build-up speed and skill set to attack defenses via intermediate and deep routes. Shorter plays to his size with a rugged demeanor that allows him to play through physical coverage and secure catches. He has above-average ball-winning talent down the field but he‚Äôs too leggy and gradual in short spaces to escape press quickly or win consistently underneath. Shorter requires longer-developing routes that allow him to turn over his stride, but once he gets going, he tilts the odds in his favor. His limitations cap his ceiling, but his toughness and ball skills raise his floor as a WR4/5 with upside.",6.12,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-shorter/32005348-4f65-1252-2fb4-216da3af656d
Michael Wilson,"Energetic wideout who plays the game with excellent urgency and effort. Wilson plays to his top speed at all times, but he needs to become a more efficient route runner to beat NFL coverage. The ball skills are a little below average, but he‚Äôs a cantankerous run blocker and has the potential to become a very good gunner on special teams. Staying healthy will be priority No. 1 for Wilson, but his versatility and competitive nature should give him a chance to become a plus NFL backup with upside.",6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-wilson/32005749-4c75-2419-b58e-7c21d98d871e
Ali Gaye,"Traits-based edge prospect who will need to improve his core strength and overall body control in order to allow those traits to make a difference as a pro. Gaye‚Äôs length and effort provide advantages at times, but tackles with power tend to give him an inordinate amount of trouble. He‚Äôs much more effective aligned wide of the tackle as a rusher and playing upfield or in gaps as a run defender. His tape shows flashes of rush potential, but finding the control and balance needed is a must.",5.99,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ali-gaye/32004741-5954-5877-64c1-07a7b7a86e8f
Dylan Horton,"Horton is a base end in a 4-3 front with adequate upper-body power but a concerning lack of anchor as a run defender. He has room for improvement with hand usage, which could give his overall play a bump, but he might lack the requisite lower-body bend and short-area quickness to hold his own as a run defender. As a rusher, Horton‚Äôs explosive take-off and power to play through a blocker‚Äôs edge are both translatable rush traits, but improvement across the board is still needed for the pro level.",5.99,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dylan-horton/3200484f-5255-5159-2676-1def569b8a93
Andrei Iosivas,"Iosivas‚Äô size, speed and athletic ability might not overwhelm NFL opponents, but those traits do give him a very real chance of battling for an NFL roster spot. He needs to work on his catch technique and level up his aggression when competing for catch space, but his ability to become a three-level route runner should work in his favor.",5.99,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrei-iosivas/3200494f-5330-7886-63af-230c5aa763a8
Ventrell Miller,"Likely two-down linebacker with good physicality but a lack of standout athletic traits. Miller appears to lack top-end speed and will lose pursuit chases on outside runs when his instincts/recognition is a step slow. He has the play strength and demeanor for life inside the box but is on the lighter side for an inside linebacker. While he‚Äôs not a playmaker, he‚Äôs hardly timid about triggering downhill and taking chances when he‚Äôs quick to diagnose the action. He can drop into zones but could be a liability when matched up in space. Miller will be a 24-year-old rookie, but he has the mental makeup and special teams potential to find backup work early on.",5.99,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ventrell-miller/32004d49-4c58-8972-3ccb-221b4a1c244f
Cameron Brown,"Instinctive cover man with good size and strength but limited starting reps due to injuries. Brown plays the game with natural talent to pick up on route tells and read the quarterback. He can play man or zone, but is much better keeping the action in front of him than chasing it down the field. While he locates the deep ball and remains calm in the process, he might not have the speed or high-point talent to keep teams from picking on him deep. He‚Äôs tough and willing in run support. Brown should have a career as a backup with some upside if he can stay healthy.",5.98,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-brown/32004252-4f28-6907-11d1-88a069f8b736
Jaylon Jones,"Big, long cornerback with imposing size but a lack of functional footwork and route anticipation to stay connected to NFL route runners. Jones can be lackadaisical with his technique, so improving in that area could play a big role in bolstering his coverage consistency. He might lack the long speed for foot races in press-man work so Cover 2 and Cover 3 could be his coverage destination thanks to his size and potential physicality, but a move to safety should not be out of the question.",5.98,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylon-jones/32004a4f-4e44-9507-e0b9-cde8b102313d
Kyu Blu Kelly,"Defender with good size, length and NFL bloodlines, but a concerning lack of recovery speed and coverage stickiness against quality route runners. When in position, Kelly possesses the ball skills and competitiveness to contest catches. He‚Äôs patient and efficient from press, but he could struggle to stay in phase with vertical route threats in man-to-man coverage. Kelly might be best suited for a backup role in a zone scheme, but the aggression will need to be cranked up in run support.",5.98,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyu-blu-kelly/32004b45-4c67-6898-ac08-b6c85f2a9a6b
Marte Mapu,"Mapu has been praised for his versatility, but he might need to prove he can excel in at least one department -- whether in run support or in coverage -- at the next level. He lacks short-area athleticism and long speed, so his man coverage might be limited to tight ends. He is highly instinctive from short zone and is a very willing hitter when playing near the box. It won‚Äôt be a surprise if Mapu adds weight and locks in as a backup weakside linebacker in a 4-3 defense as a pro.",5.98,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marte-mapu/32004d41-5077-5385-a977-698119e94108
Moro Ojomo,"Naturally powerful defensive lineman caught somewhere between end and tackle. Ojomo is best-suited as a base end but doesn‚Äôt really have the get-off quickness to exploit interior blockers as an inside rusher on passing downs. He‚Äôs tight in his lower body, and his movements lack fluidity, but he can fight his way through blocks with upper-body power and a will to make it happen. Ojomo plays hard throughout the rep and will find production with his secondary effort, but he might cap out as a solid backup in either an odd or even front.",5.98,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/moro-ojomo/32004f4a-4f42-6541-624d-798355140764
Jayden Reed,"Utility wideout with the ability to take snaps at multiple receiver positions while offering both kickoff and punt return talent. Reed looks smaller in many of his matchups, but he is rarely deterred by size. He‚Äôs too tight-hipped for stop-start routes on the tree, but he operates with good route speed and should improve his ability to separate with additional development and experience on the next level. His ball skills and feel for positioning on deep throws and jump balls are unquestioned. Limiting his focus drops on short and intermediate throws will be critical to becoming a long-term NFL contributor.",5.98,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jayden-reed/32005245-4526-3142-e96f-a871c08a1138
MJ Anderson,"Defensive lineman with old-school vibes, from his burly frame to his four-point stance. Anderson simply hasn‚Äôt played enough football to be technically proficient or to have the football IQ that will be necessary on the next level, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt develop both with time. He‚Äôs naturally powerful and does a nice job of using force to attack and play around blocks in both the run game and as a reduced rusher on passing downs. He lacks range as a 4-3 end, so teams might need to decide where and how to play him, but he has the upside to become a solid rotational player.",5.97,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mj-anderson/3200414e-4438-1736-6a4f-4fc8af2b6de7
Sydney Brown,"A physical safety who is limited by a lack of fluidity in space. Brown has straight-line speed and is very effective mapping his transit to the ball-carrier near the line of scrimmage. However, his missed tackles are concerning considering the position he plays. He competes hard in man coverage, using everything at his disposal to prevent tight ends from making plays, but above average pass-catchers could be too much for him to handle as a pro. Brown will need to prove he can win in the box and shine on special teams to stick around in the league.",5.97,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sydney-brown/32004252-4f69-5003-e72b-502ae9aa1558
Zach Harrison,"Harrison is big and long with the ability to neutralize base blocks as a 4-3 base end, but his gradual movement and lack of playmaking urgency limited his overall production. Harrison has the physical tools to create occasional advantages early in the rush but needs to get better at capitalizing on them. His size and length will always be appealing, but a more fiery demeanor on the field might be needed to raise his status beyond rotational end.",5.97,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-harrison/32004841-5264-7601-2cfe-d334c90e441f
Quindell Johnson,"Versatile safety prospect with the instincts, toughness and athletic attributes to play for a unit featuring scheme variance. Johnson has adequate NFL size and plays with clean hips and footwork in space. He‚Äôs capable of playing high safety or lining up over bigger slot receivers but could be overmatched if asked to carry speedsters around the field. He‚Äôs a heads-up run defender ready to mix it up but needs to balance his urgency with better control when it‚Äôs time to break down and tackle. Johnson is a capable backup safety and might have the ability to step into a more prominent role in the future.",5.97,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quindell-johnson/32004a4f-4858-4054-c576-e248e44ff181
Kendre Miller,"The size and production will check important boxes, but Miller‚Äôs lack of tempo and explosiveness between the tackles could turn him into a grinder against the speed of NFL defenses. His restricted stride length provides greater control to cut early in the run, but it works against him when he needs to hit the gas and stride past linebackers. He has the size and strength to keep runs moving though contact, although he could be an even better run finisher. His third-down value is relatively low, so he will need to sell himself as an early down backup on the next level.",5.97,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kendre-miller/32004d49-4c36-9085-7b40-672b4733cbc6
Jason Brownlee,"Perimeter wideout with NFL size, an outstanding catch radius and the potential to outplay his draft slotting. Brownlee will need to prove his speed, but he can make top-flight contested catches down the field and has the spring and length to outreach opponents when the ball is in the air. His contested catch count is entirely too high, but he can be his own worst enemy in that regard thanks to unrefined route running. Brownlee is a competitive worker and has enough flash plays on tape to believe that he might have upside to be cultivated.",5.96,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jason-brownlee/32004252-4f82-6391-316a-fcdeea27b8cb
DJ Dale,"Undersized nose tackle with good play strength and technique to make up for a lack of desired mass and length. Dale was a three-year starter for a talent-rich defense, using nimble feet and sudden hands to keep from being engulfed by bigger bodies. He can set edges or attack gaps but matchups against bigger NFL interior defenders will be much more challenging. A lack of desired size and pass rush might put a ceiling on his draft stock, but he should offer immediate rotational help as a middle-rounder.",5.96,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dj-dale/32004441-4c17-3037-260b-5382854136a6
Jaren Hall,"An undersized pocket quarterback with unimpressive arm strength, Hall‚Äôs field command gives him a shot to make it at the next level. He throws with excellent ball placement to targets on the move and delivers a feathery soft deep ball with accuracy. His lack of drive velocity creates smaller margins for error and his timing needs to be impeccable to beat NFL man coverage. Hall operates with ideal poise from the pocket. He does an adequate job of reading coverages and getting rid of the ball without taking sacks. The size and arm strength will concern some teams, but offenses operating out of heavy play-action with levels-based route concepts could target him as a solid future backup.",5.96,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaren-hall/32004841-4c35-8200-d3b2-64a39d20a53c
Aidan O'Connell,"O‚ÄôConnell‚Äôs 2021 tape is better than what we saw from him in 2022, but there were still flashes last season. He‚Äôs a pocket passer who can throw with solid accuracy over the first two levels but struggles with trajectory and rhythm on deep targets. O‚ÄôConnell has below-average mobility inside and outside the pocket. He needs to keep his progressions on schedule and his throws on time to make up for average arm strength. He had to carry a heavy percentage of the offense on his back at Purdue and could benefit from an offense that allows him to manage games. O‚ÄôConnell has backup potential and his upside is slightly above average.",5.96,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aidan-o-connell/32004f43-4f07-5507-fffe-35de4751ec57
DeMarvion Overshown,"Former safety turned linebacker who has slowly but surely improved his feet and recognition over the last three seasons. Whether playing inside or outside, Overshown will need to get stronger and more effective at taking on blockers and tackling with security. His tape shows much improved key reading and play recognition, which could prove critical in allowing him to play at a consistently faster pace to the football. Overshown could struggle to hold up to downhill running attacks, but his instincts and blitz talent create a potential opportunity for him as a nickel/dime linebacker.",5.96,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demarvion-overshown/32004f56-4524-9174-45a2-1631b707074e
Dante Stills,"Stills lacks the girth of a 4-3 three-technique, the get-off of a 4-3 end and the two-gapping take-on of a traditional odd-front end. However, he has physical/play attributes that have allowed him to play in all three spots. Finding a fit for him will be paramount, but his quickness and agility will be valued in schemes employing gaming, active fronts. He can be a handful as a twisting interior rusher, but he needs to develop go-to rush moves to help create additional value in that area. Stills could find rotational reps as an odd- or even-front end with the ability to rush from the interior.",5.96,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dante-stills/32005354-4940-1047-64a1-126f952db8f0
TJ Bass,"Former tackle projecting to guard-only prospect with a broad frame, good power and below-average athleticism. Bass‚Äô lack of arm length will be a concern at any O-line position, but he plays with inside hands and decent know-how, so he should be able to work around it. He‚Äôs tight-hipped and doesn‚Äôt play with great pad level or a wide base but still manages to create some movement with powerful leg drive. He lacks lateral quickness as a zone blocker and loses effectiveness the further he gets away from home base. Bass‚Äô toughness and size will give him a leg up in a battle for a backup role.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tj-bass/32004241-5355-2614-f91b-643ddcac017a
Nick Broeker,Guard prospect with average size who has the ability to punch above his weight as a run blocker. Broeker is limited as a move blocker but thrives when firing out and running his feet through contact to open lanes. He has very strong hands and consistently works to finish his blocks. His hand usage and inconsistent body control land his pass protection a few notches below his run blocking and those issues will take time to clean up. Broeker is a below-average athlete with above-average play strength and has the talent to become a starting guard in a downhill run scheme.,5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-broeker/32004252-4f09-5305-48d6-37f2bcefb0d5
Jaxson Kirkland,"Kirkland is likely to ply his trade as a guard, but he might be able to step in at tackle in a pinch. His barrel-chested, high-cut frame looks out of place at guard. He is unable to generate the leverage or power needed as a downhill blocker but does a decent job on positional blocks on the move. In protection, bull rushers can get under him and drive him into the pocket, but he‚Äôs quick with his hands and can get on top of rushers quickly when he needs to. His pass protection background could bolster his chances as a Day 3 pick and future backup.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaxson-kirkland/32004b49-5250-4849-9dd3-67221e0f69a5
Owen Pappoe,"Undersized linebacker with impressive build, good speed and long arms. Despite all of his traits, Pappoe failed to rack up impact production during his time at Auburn due to his lack of instincts and playmaking ability. He struggles to leverage the gaps and take on climbing blockers effectively, so a move to Will linebacker should allow him to play more run-and-chase, which suits him. He doesn‚Äôt look like an NFL starter on tape, but third down and special teams potential will give him a shot at a backup role.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/owen-pappoe/32005041-5072-3174-a0f2-6b355d672760
Jalen Redmond,"Redmond's NFL Scouting Combine testing was outstanding, as he displayed quickness and explosiveness that doesn't always show up on his college tape. He possesses plenty of toughness but moves on heavy feet. His lack of bend makes him a linear mover with limited playmaking potential. While he might not fill up an NFL stat sheet, he does have the base strength for consideration as a rotational 4-3 nose tackle with some block-eating elements to his game.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-redmond/32005245-4461-3410-5102-5e80a97e82ca
Christopher Smith II,"Undersized free safety with decent athletic ability and toughness to bolster roster depth. Smith has man-cover talent and range to play over the top, but he was often more effective attacking downhill on routes underneath and stopping plays. He‚Äôs willing in run support but tackling big backs could be an issue. Despite his limited size, his reliability in coverage is a big advantage against today‚Äôs offensive attacks.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christopher-smith-ii/3200534d-4982-9490-6b43-3a3a8d668113
Parker Washington,"It‚Äôs easy to see that Washington has worked hard on all aspects of his craft. He‚Äôs not the most athletically gifted player, but he uses all of his talent to maximize his on-field production. Washington plays with well-developed ball skills and the toughness needed to make challenging catches, but finding open windows against man coverage will be difficult, due to his lack of shake and separation. His size and run-after-catch ability help his cause as a backup and possession slot receiver.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/parker-washington/32005741-5360-4325-2e4f-b11d5ed26427
Dorian Williams,"Team captain with athletic, tapered build and eye-catching production. Williams looks and moves more like a big box safety with his bursts to the football and open-field fluidity. Lacking the size and strength to match up with NFL take-on duties near the line, Williams needs to become more adept at slipping blocks and staying a step ahead of the blocking scheme. His coverage potential and special teams background will give his roster quest a boost as a likely Day 3 selection looking to fit into a backup role as a Will linebacker.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dorian-williams/32005749-4c24-3940-708f-17c023a4d993
Stetson Bennett,"Bennett will turn 26 years old during his rookie season and he‚Äôs small in stature relative to today‚Äôs game. Those two things will work against him, but his history of elevating his play in spotlight games against the best competition should be a factor for some teams. He doesn‚Äôt have a plus arm and his accuracy and placement can vary from drive to drive, but he throws with anticipation and has shown an ability to get through progressions as a pro-style passer. He‚Äôs rarely sacked and has the mobility to do damage outside of the pocket. Bennett has backup potential for a timing-based passing attack that includes concepts often seen in the Shanahan offense.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/stetson-bennett/32004245-4e44-0455-998d-976cf08f74c6
Mark Evans II,"Feisty tackle-to-guard prospect who plays with the desired mindset and tenacity that evaluators will love. Evans is a hardworking run blocker with strong hands and ample leg drive but fails to create consistent leverage at the point of attack. He‚Äôs a willing combatant in both the run and pass game but lacks consistent body control and hand usage. He has the potential to be a make-it player, but the pass protection must significantly improve.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mark-evans-ii/32004556-4181-5279-43d3-07d4c4e1ab17
D'Shawn Jamison,"Undersized perimeter cornerback with good ball skills and the talent to handle full-time return duties if he makes a team. Jamison carries the athletic profile of an NFL player with twitchy feet, loose hips and make-up speed to run down mistakes. He might need to move inside, where he will have to prove he can stay connected to route runners without playing from his desired side-shuffle technique. The route anticipation is nothing special, but his ball skills and competitiveness might be good enough to create a roster opportunity as a backup with return talent.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-shawn-jamison/32004a41-4d78-3508-8d9e-03f4f491b63c
Brent Laing,Laing lacks ideal length and will need to add more mass to his frame to catch up with some of the other prospects in the draft. He played guard and center at East-West Shrine Bowl practices and looked completely comfortable doing so. He‚Äôs a plus athlete who can get to back-side blocks and climb in space to find his targets. He needs to improve his hand placement in pass protection and prove he can level up to NFL competition. Laing appears to have some upside as a dual-position backup.,5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brent-laing/32004c41-4932-0419-481a-397ac6c04c11
Matt Landers,"Landers spent his first four seasons at Georgia, managing just 12 total catches before having a solid 2021 season at Toledo and then a stronger 2022 campaign at Arkansas. He‚Äôs still unrefined as a receiver, but his size, athleticism and potential as a ball-winner are noteworthy. He has legitimate build-up speed deep and his long strides help him separate. He‚Äôs a developmental prospect with upside and should hear his name called on Day 3 of the draft.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-landers/32004c41-4e08-3937-d092-73c98c37b441
Hunter Luepke,"Versatile fullback with experience as a tailback, tight end and Wildcat option. Luepke is a jack-of-all-trades who has posted an impressive touchdown-per-touch ratio as both a runner and pass-catcher. He‚Äôs expected to test well and has the ability to compete for reps as a core special-teamer. While he has soft hands and has shown some route-running savvy, he will need to prove himself as a lead blocker if he is to excite NFL offensive coordinators.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/hunter-luepke/32004c55-4558-2275-a74b-84e7c261086e
Ochaun Mathis,"Mathis‚Äô 2020 season put him on the map as an edge defender to look out for in the future, but he‚Äôs failed to hit those production markers since then. He has good size and outstanding length but needs more time in the weight room. He struggles against downhill running attacks but is a slippery tackler who can cast a wide net near his gaps. Mathis‚Äô pressure and sack counts aren‚Äôt as high as they should be with his athletic ability and traits. If a team can get him to become a more skilled and attack-oriented rusher, it might find a prospect who outplays his draft slotting as a 3-4 rush linebacker.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ochaun-mathis/32004d41-5420-5681-c873-f7d51b3dccfc
Noah Sewell,"Inside 'backer possessing throwback demeanor as a physical but limited prospect. Sewell has good power to take on blocks and muddy the middle, but his lack of pursuit speed and change-of-direction quickness prevent him from consistently making the stop. He needs to become more anticipatory and read play development more effectively, as he‚Äôs missing the tools necessary to overcome missteps.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/noah-sewell/32005345-5745-9337-b3d8-84063b8930fa
Sean Tucker,"Compact, early down backup candidate with adequate size, good contact balance and instinctive features that create opportunities outside the blocking scheme. Tucker lacks the slashing qualities needed to speed through the line and past linebackers. However, he can navigate run lanes and has plenty of balance to keep the run moving after contact. He has lateral elusiveness and the build-up speed to outrun defenders in the open field. While he caught passes in the Syracuse offense, he lacks true third down talent.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-tucker/32005455-4329-9932-5316-9ae83817e6e1
Jalen Wayne,"Wayne brings a noticeable level of maturity and football intelligence with him. He doesn‚Äôt have the boosters to rocket past pro coverage, but he runs routes with an excellent feel for leverage to open opportunities inside the route. He has outside receiver size but might offer enough footwork and manipulation to run routes as a big slot. Wayne didn‚Äôt win contested catches at the expected rate relative to his body control and traits, but his ball skills appear to meet NFL standards and should give him a shot at becoming a competent backup.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-wayne/32005741-5942-4121-5953-e239688a3987
Dee Winters,"A versatile linebacker with inside/outside experience, Winters needs to take on blockers with the same intensity he displays when he hits ball-carriers. He lacks ideal size, so he will need to win with play speed and aggression in attacking the play design. He‚Äôs adequate dropping into space and can get after the pocket as a blitzer. He might be best suited for a role as a run and strike Will linebacker, but he has the instincts and feel to play inside if he‚Äôs protected by the front. Winters has Day 3 draft value with an average ceiling.",5.94,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dee-winters/32005749-4e76-7442-26b1-69f74bb7e584
Robert Beal Jr.,"Beal has been missed out on snaps to more talented players and doesn‚Äôt have a history of production that will excite teams, but his size, length and athletic ability are all moldable elements that could attract a team on Day 3. He lacks awareness as a run defender and possesses just average range as a tackler, but he can hold his ground against power. As a rusher, the tape can be a little uneven, but he flashes moves and counters that appear to be instinctive and potential fuel for development. Beal is a developmental edge defender who needs to prove himself on special teams while he continues learning the position.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-beal-jr/32004245-4115-8040-cf61-5173f5b6029d
YaYa Diaby,"Diaby plays with strong hands and clear eyes at the point of attack. He can strike and separate as a two-gapping five-technique or pursue and tackle as a 4-3 base end. He‚Äôs a power rusher lacking an instinctive approach to beat better NFL tackles, but his lateral quickness and short-area burst make Diaby perfect for a twisting/gaming front. His frame and skill set could attract attention as an odd- or even-front end with his ceiling being defined by how much he‚Äôs able to improve his creativity as a rusher.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/yaya-diaby/32004449-4105-1911-562c-7d76f4e49b99
Jalen Graham,"Energy-driven hybrid player who will need to make a full-time conversion to a 4-3 linebacker role. Graham plays faster than he‚Äôs likely to test thanks to his football instincts and desire to get to where the ball is going. He needs to get a little bigger and improve his technique when fitting the run, but he‚Äôs very willing to take on blocks and play with the aggression needed for the position. He‚Äôs limited in man coverage, but he‚Äôs an instinctive ballhawk when dropping into zone. Graham has the potential to compete as a backup Will linebacker and has upside still left to mine.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-graham/32004752-4119-9869-ffab-fccc38b6c057
Tashawn Manning,"Manning‚Äôs athletic limitations will be frowned upon by some teams, but he‚Äôs huge, long and powerful. Even without the knee bend and lateral quickness, he can still do enough for consideration as a backup guard. He will need to play in a downhill scheme full of gap plays and inside zone. His reps could be hit or miss, but his power is obvious when he connects and runs his feet. He lacks range but can swallow bull rushers without much concern. Manning might be a late-round or undrafted consideration, but players with his traits tend to find their way onto rosters.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tashawn-manning/32004d41-4e53-5860-59be-4412044bbfb5
Brodric Martin,"Space-eating nose tackle for consideration in both odd and even fronts. Martin‚Äôs size and length will be coveted by NFL teams, but his impact on games can be blunted at times due to a lack of leverage to hold his anchor. If he can play with a little better bend and quicker hands, he has the awareness and ability to handle two-gapping duties. He can take on double teams with better technique and more work. Martin‚Äôs traits and talent create Day 3 draft value as a rotational interior lineman.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brodric-martin/32004d41-5252-2663-52b8-5b30397ff3b5
Anfernee Orji,"Orji plays a frenetic brand of football that helps get him to the football but also creates consistency issues. When the ball is snapped, he‚Äôs in attack mode whether he‚Äôs a run blitzer or an urgent linebacker. He makes up for what he lacks in timed speed with aggressive angles and an ability to slip climbing blocks to meet the ball-carrier near the line. He sees too many tackles slip from his grasp, but he‚Äôs also going to be in position to sniff a tackle when other linebackers are stuck to blocks. The traits, instincts and coverage are below average, but his play demeanor and special teams potential could give a chance to find a home.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anfernee-orji/32004f52-4a41-5291-4ac4-28d093af19ca
Starling Thomas V,"Squatty and strong, Thomas will need to prove he can slide inside to the slot after a career of playing outside. He‚Äôs both fast and quick. He plays with a good feel for route development, which explains his on-ball production. Thomas will lean and lunge at times, diminishing his balance in coverage, and he misses interception opportunities because of a lack of eye balance between the receiver and quarterback. He can phase and crowd routes, and is physical through the catch try. Thomas needs to play tougher in run support to make the transition to nickel, but he‚Äôs talented enough to earn a roster spot.",5.93,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/starling-thomas-v/32005448-4f44-3334-5360-346720479b88
Kei'Trel Clark,"Clark is small but fast. He plays with twitchy feet and a competitive demeanor when challenging the throw. He‚Äôs capable of stalking short and intermediate routes with a feel for the passing lane, but his lack of size and length shows up down the field. While the ball skills and athletic traits work in his favor, trouble with run support and big slot targets could be difficult obstacles to overcome in the NFL.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kei-trel-clark/3200434c-4139-5333-4a18-780ebdf70394
Viliami Fehoko Jr.,"Fehoko‚Äôs body type will require teams to decide whether they want him to play base end in a 4-3 defense or ask him to add weight so they can use him as a hybrid end/tackle in a 3-4. He plays with a nose for the football and a chippy attitude. He‚Äôs been productive in both phases over the last two seasons, but we will see if that translates against better competition. While he‚Äôs not as anchor-based as teams might like due to his lack of leverage, he has a nasty spin counter that could be effective as a sub-package rusher. He‚Äôs strong, tough and active with the talent to become an NFL backup.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/viliami-fehoko-jr/32004645-4861-8217-1d00-cf690e1c911e
Jon Gaines II,"Move-blocking guard whose athleticism doesn‚Äôt guarantee consistent body control or balance in his play. Gaines is highly intelligent with a clear understanding of his duties on every snap. His hand placement can be a little sloppy, which diminishes his block sustain in the run game. While Gaines moves well as a run blocker, he struggles to stay under control and in front of opponents while mirroring. Gaines has the mental makeup coaches will like, but he needs to upgrade his protection technique and improve his core strength. He has backup guard/center potential.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jon-gaines-ii/32004741-4952-8003-df7b-681a2f35ed49
Brandon Hill,"Aggressive down safety with above-average cover traits but below-average instincts and consistency in run support. Hill is an equal opportunity hitter regardless of position or size of the opponent, but he needs to balance forceful striking with more wrap-up tackling. He is twitchy and plays with closing speed, which might make him a better fit for man coverage than zone, where he struggles to play with awareness and discipline. Hill has the demeanor and skill level to compete for a backup spot and should find special teams snaps early in his NFL career.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-hill/32004849-4c10-1689-c41d-d3f1a7ff1049
Roschon Johnson,"Power back with bruising frame who fits the football cliche of ‚Äútough, smart and dependable.‚Äù Johnson isn‚Äôt overly creative and lacks the juice to hit quick-closing NFL holes. He needs it blocked up so he can get downhill and uncork his power on the second level. While his lack of suddenness makes him somewhat limited as a runner, he will be better at stuffing blitzers than many of the No. 3 backs currently in the league. Johnson might be fighting off competition every year in camp, but his toughness and four-phase special teams value could give him an advantage.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/roschon-johnson/32004a4f-4865-2931-d4f5-6e3ddf27f82a
Tiawan Mullen,"Mullen comes from NFL bloodlines, which shows in his athletic ability and talent as a cover man. He was out of position as a perimeter cornerback and should fit in nicely with a move to the slot. He has quick feet and smooth hips to shade the route, but he needs to play with better discipline to prevent early hip commitment that receivers can use against him. Mullen is very tough as a run defender and takes excellent angles to the action on the move. His lack of length could hurt him in the draft, but he has the talent to play the pro game.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tiawan-mullen/32004d55-4c35-8771-bb12-0c92be23d4cb
Jason Taylor II,"Taylor offers well-defined strengths and obvious areas of concern that should allow for teams to deploy him in the best manner possible if they are honest in their assessments. He boasts an NFL frame and is a powerful tackler who can stop rushers and pass-catchers in their tracks. Though his speed and agility are below par, he‚Äôs highly instinctive and possesses the skills to make plays on the ball as a deep safety. Figuring out when to play him low and when to play him high will be the challenge for defensive coordinators, but even as a backup, he brings four-phase special teams talent to the table immediately.",5.92,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jason-taylor-ii/32005441-5981-2805-475a-65a087a5aa71
Alex Forsyth,"A steady center/guard option with good size and length, Forsyth plays with technique and consistency that offensive line coaches will appreciate. He wasn‚Äôt asked to play with much range from home base but gets into his block with pop and is consistent in his effort to sustain and finish the assignment. He has some issues protecting the A-gaps at times, and the pre-snap penalties are a concern. Forsyth‚Äôs poor explosiveness testing at the NFL Scouting Combine could cause concerns for teams looking at him late on Day 3 of the draft.",5.91,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-forsyth/3200464f-5256-6553-cf04-7fe0756ccf29
Bryce Baringer,"Power punter able to flip the field with his great, big leg. He's currently more like a power pitcher who can hit a high number on the radar gun but is unable to control where it goes. He has the talent to kick on the next level but might need to dial it back and kick with better hang-time and short-field touch to truly impress NFL teams.",5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-baringer/32004241-5214-5519-a728-3afd68fd5264
Richard Gouraige,"Durable and dependable, Gouraige has logged 42 career starts splitting time between tackle and guard. While he has started at left tackle over the last two seasons, teams might be more inclined to bump him inside due to a lack of desired length. He‚Äôs instinctive and plays with sound technique, but he could struggle when matched with size and power across from him. Gouraige‚Äôs pass protection experience at tackle should benefit him, but athletic limitations might ultimately cap his draft value and career ceiling.",5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/richard-gouraige/3200474f-5530-7647-b893-8b438a6dc351
Ryan Hayes,"Two-year starter at left tackle for a unit that won consecutive Joe Moore Awards (best offensive line in college football). He‚Äôs tall and plays with good technique and strong hands, but Hayes is missing functional length as a tackle. He tough at the point of attack and gets into space with athletic movements but he plays with a slightly elevated pad level that could slow a transition inside to guard. He‚Äôs solid in pass protection, but he plays with an average anchor and might not have the range to keep speed rushers from tormenting the pocket. He could become an average player at tackle or guard in the pros.",5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-hayes/32004841-5942-5163-913c-79c056f10685
Zack Kuntz,"Kuntz is expected to light up the NFL Scouting Combine with his speed and athleticism, but he‚Äôs not as fluid on tape as you might expect. He needs to keep filling out his extremely long frame, as he plays more like a big receiver than a tight end. His hands are subpar and he‚Äôs not strong enough to outwork grabby coverage or win contested catches right now. A team could view him as a Day 3 pick and stash him on the practice squad while he continues to develop.",5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zack-kuntz/32004b55-4e18-4573-2a82-42b17b1995fa
Kenny McIntosh,McIntosh is best suited for a complementary role that allows him to explore the flanks of the offense instead of trying to pound and create between the tackles. He lacks the vision to recognize and exploit opportunities quickly and the elusiveness to dart in and out of developing run lanes. He‚Äôs more than capable of finding big runs over the tackles and becomes a more physical finisher as the run progresses. McIntosh has excellent hands and the potential to mismatch coverages when isolated out of the backfield. He could become a RB2 with full-time third-down reps.,5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-mcintosh/32004d43-4950-0298-3acc-043d70d34f9d
Kaevon Merriweather,"Merriweather has the size and toughness of an NFL safety but needs to improve his consistency to finish tackles near the box. He could struggle to keep up with wide receivers who get matched with him in space. He might have the tools necessary to cover tight ends, but he could be at his best playing short zone as a dime safety. Overall, Merriweather has physical traits that give him a chance to find a home as a backup safety.",5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kaevon-merriweather/32004d45-5261-9548-c516-7bfed17bf102
Jalen Moreno-Cropper,"Slot receiver with adequate size who finds ways to get open thanks to tempo variance over route acumen. Moreno-Cropper‚Äôs ball skills shine when he‚Äôs elevating and making adjustments mid-flight, but he struggles when attempting to play through contact and make contested catches. His versatility to throw, run jet sweeps and operate outside of the norm for his position could be intriguing for creative play-callers and teams looking to add competition at receiver on Day 3.",5.9,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-moreno-cropper/32004352-4f34-0100-ad8e-53dd701ed24d
Jake Andrews,"Andrews might lack length and be viewed as only a center at the next level, but he plays with strong hands, a wide frame and exceptional strength at the point of attack. His inability to trigger his feet quickly and make fluid redirections in space show up in run blocking and pass protection, but his ability to square up and hold his own against a true nose tackle over the top of him is a valuable talent. Players with Andrews‚Äô thickness and drive-blocking talent tend to find their way onto rosters and often end up sticking around.",5.89,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-andrews/3200414e-4466-3449-b06b-e5ec1c250418
Jerrod Clark,"Nose tackle whose size is a double-edged sword. Clark lacks the build and body type of a true NFL nose, so additional weight limits his natural athleticism inside. He needs to make better use of his length to begin stacking blocks and controlling the point of attack. Clark is a former high school tight end with decent feet, so improved quickness could help him become a more disruptive interior talent.",5.89,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerrod-clark/3200434c-4138-3865-4d47-f02b0308a824
Dontay Demus Jr.,"High-cut wideout with NFL size, elite arm length and soft hands. Demus will struggle to beat press coverage and lacks the athletic ability to shake man coverage underneath. He‚Äôs a long-strider who can build up speed as the route progresses and is best-suited for a layered passing scheme where he can stretch his legs and stride to some separation across the field. He‚Äôs an explosive leaper with the potential to become a jump-ball winner down the field, but he‚Äôs a niche prospect with a modest ceiling.",5.89,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dontay-demus-jr/32004445-4d78-1426-1ee0-7b51f9fea1eb
Anthony Johnson,"Johnson‚Äôs physical traits and natural footwork in phasing routes in space is very appealing, but certain athletic limitations could cause evaluators to pump the brakes when grading him. He can block a release from press or squeeze route breaks from his pedal or a side shuffle but will struggle to keep pace with deep targets from man. Sticky hips make flat-footed transitions and open-field tackling challenging tasks for him, so teams will need to have a plan for optimizing his strengths while minimizing his limitations.",5.89,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-johnson/32004a4f-4805-7904-a7a8-8cd8295cb244
John Ojukwu,"College tackle with the build and skill set that would make him a better fit at guard in the NFL. Ojukwu has played a tremendous amount of college football and has a solid understanding of fundamentals. He uses big hands and long arms to jar and displace opponents at the point of attack, but it can break down quickly for him when he‚Äôs forced to operate in space as a run blocker or in pass protection. Ojukwu‚Äôs athletic limitations are balanced out by his size and power. He should compete for a roster spot as a late Day 3 selection.",5.89,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-ojukwu/32004f4a-5520-7645-8291-d4dfd631d061
Dontayvion Wicks,"Wicks proved in 2021 that he has a set of skills to threaten defenses with big-play potential, but he‚Äôs coming off a disappointing 2022 season. Focus drops have been an issue for him over the last two seasons, but they seemed to impact his overall confidence in 2022. He lacks attention to detail as a route runner but it is worth noting that he finds ways to separate with instincts and pure athleticism. Wicks has talent to cultivate, but gaining the confidence of a GM, head coach or quarterback must start with catching the football more consistently.",5.89,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dontayvion-wicks/32005749-4362-2867-1ce9-aa6b2d842d21
Myles Brooks,"A perimeter man corner with good size and instincts, Brooks will need to prove he can continue his on-ball production against better competition. He will need to tighten up his technique, but he has the feet and feel to play press. Also, he does a nice job of competing against the route and fighting for positioning when the ball goes up. He has plus ball skills and innate timing to make plays on the throw but might need to prove his top-end speed in testing. He will have occasional issues with downfield penalties and is a below-average run defender, but he has the talent to work his way onto an NFL roster.",5.88,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/myles-brooks/32004252-4f15-6009-32e4-646edf52081e
Ronnie Hickman Jr.,"Two-year starter with NFL size but lacking functional change of direction as an open-field tackler. Hickman is at his best as a down safety or big nickel, where he doesn‚Äôt have to close as much distance on the runner or pass-catcher. He can make plays as a run defender and in coverage when he‚Äôs in position, but issues redirecting in small spaces create uncertainty that he can play consistently enough to move beyond backup status.",5.88,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronnie-hickman-jr/32004849-4331-9062-15db-5cdb3a16baf7
Blake Whiteheart,"Whiteheart has below-average size and mass for a blocking tight end, but he makes up for it with above-average grit and technique to sustain. He‚Äôs a better pass-catcher than the production might indicate. Also, he shows impressive concentration and soft hands when the ball comes his way. He‚Äôs tough but will need to get bigger and stronger to block NFL defenders, as he‚Äôs unlikely to earn a living as just a pass-catcher. Whiteheart has solid tape and could become a backup as a Day 3 draft pick.",5.88,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/blake-whiteheart/32005748-4963-9076-aca2-3ff9b42af377
Earl Bostick Jr.,"Athletic tackle who currently offers more in pass protection than he does as a run blocker. Bostic has quick feet and good length, but he lacks play strength in his upper half. He‚Äôs quick to the spot as a lateral blocker and is smooth when asked to pull. He has trouble neutralizing and sustaining base blocks in front of him and doesn‚Äôt play with enough grit at the point of attack. His pass protection features a quality mirror and good redirection against athletic rushers, but he‚Äôll need to sit and anchor more consistently to earn a role as an NFL swing tackle.",5.87,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/earl-bostick-jr/3200424f-5364-8319-e100-a6ce73f5030b
Xavier Hutchinson,"Perimeter wideout whose catch production has been bolstered by a heavy target rate and a variety of short, catch-and-run throws. Hutchinson has good size, but average speed and ball skills force him into a lot of contested catch situations. He has the track record of a late bloomer, showing improvement in his play from year to year and even month to month. He plays with a competitive demeanor and has the tools to keep improving as a route runner, but he needs to upgrade his hands and overall skill set in order to fight for more than a back-end roster spot.",5.87,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xavier-hutchinson/32004855-5430-4546-3068-451b429a0c40
Cam Jones,"Inside linebacker with a lean but athletic build. Jones will get stuck on blocks from time to time, but generally finds his way to the football in position to make a play. He has the experience necessary to recognize play design and turn on the acceleration quickly against wide-flowing runs. He lacks ideal size, length and speed but has the demeanor and feel needed to become a solid backup and core special teams performer.",5.87,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-jones/32004a4f-4e14-8503-ed48-c3f6d7e74eb4
Keaton Mitchell,"Small but speedy, Mitchell amassed over 2,900 scrimmage yards and 24 touchdowns over the last two seasons. He mashes the gas pedal and gets to top speed quickly. He can outflank defenses and chalk up a long run if defenses aren‚Äôt ready for him. However, he needs a clear point of entry inside and isn‚Äôt built to withstand the punishment that goes along with interior running in the NFL. Teams will need to have a plan for him, but he‚Äôs electric with the ball in his hands. His big-play potential could be hard to pass up for teams needing more juice.",5.87,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keaton-mitchell/32004d49-5437-6653-df6c-6e9f57253f37
Daniel Scott,"A team captain with size, tools and six seasons of collegiate experience, Scott will turn 25 during the 2023 season. His age could hurt his chances with some teams, but his athleticism and four-phase special teams background will help him with others. He‚Äôs more confident and capable as a field-reading center fielder than he is sifting through bunch formations and matching in man coverage. He was a teammate to four Cal defensive backs who were drafted in recent years, and he could be next up thanks to his football character and special teams talent.",5.87,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daniel-scott/32005343-4f22-4944-aef6-753f2a1cb878
Alex Austin,"Austin‚Äôs size, length and football IQ work in his favor, but there is a lack of consistency with his man coverage that could limit the way NFL teams use him. He‚Äôs decent at mirroring the release from press but struggles to stay in-phase with quality route runners. He plays with below-average top-end speed and recovery burst in man coverage, but his instincts and awareness take him where he needs to go from off-man and zone coverage. Austin can play some press and a variety of zones and offers backup potential as a Day 3 option.",5.86,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-austin/32004155-5308-9816-8d6f-de43c00a54cc
Chamarri Conner,"Conner‚Äôs size and versatility could buy him time on a roster, but he might need to keep fighting for his spot. He misses too many tackles due to risky angles and struggles coming to balance in the open field. The speed and pattern matching aren‚Äôt great, but the ball skills are above average. Conner has late Day 3 value as a potential backup.",5.86,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chamarri-conner/3200434f-4e43-3448-2edc-e18787ceb0c4
Clayton Tune,"Resilient in the face of adversity, Tune has proven that he can come back from slow starts and finish seasons strong. He‚Äôs more of a snap-taker than playmaker. He‚Äôs a full-field reader who needs plays to stay on time, as he lacks improvisational talent. Without a plus physical or athletic profile to lean on, Tune must learn to speed up his eyes, quiet his feet and improve his post-snap process to beat NFL defenses with timing and accuracy.",5.86,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clayton-tune/32005455-4e20-7645-a8d5-751fe16584b1
Deuce Vaughn,"Vaughn‚Äôs playing style is similar to that of former NFL running back Jacquizz Rodgers, but Rodgers was much heavier than Vaughn at a similar height. Despite the versatility, production and durability, teams might focus on his lack of size. However, he sees the field clearly, is fearless between the tackles, possesses quality contact balance and finds his way into the end zone as a runner and receiver. Vaughn has an uphill climb ahead of him, but his history of consistent, high-end production makes the climb to success seem achievable.",5.86,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deuce-vaughn/32005641-5542-4979-415d-9403ea793f9b
Ronnie Bell,"True Michigan Man, displaying the competitive spirit and work ethic expected inside the program. Bell made it back in 2022 after sustaining an ACL tear in 2021, but he still looked a little passive getting in and out of breaks at times. His surprisingly low contested catch total is a bit deceiving, as the tape shows some incredible near-catches at challenging angles. So, his ball skills are a strength. He can catch what is thrown to him but might need to do it against zone or with help from scheme, as he potentially lacks the separation traits to get open consistently on the next level.",5.85,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronnie-bell/32004245-4c59-6505-43ce-5ccd36c0d34a
Bryce Ford-Wheaton,"Ford-Wheaton is a big, long wideout specializing in downfield jump-ball victories. He‚Äôs a high-riser with an above-average wingspan, but he rarely slips past press coverage easily and fails to separate like he should relative to the blazing speed he showed at the NFL Scouting Combine. He‚Äôs a raw route runner with tight hips and a lack of attention to detail that allows defenders to anticipate breaks and contest his catches on a regular basis. Ford-Wheaton has the size and hand strength to post victories on 50-50 throws, but he will need to prove he can consistently play to his athletic ability.",5.85,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-ford-wheaton/3200464f-5238-9868-32d8-c5dc5e73b834
Desjuan Johnson,"Johnson is as tough as it gets at the point of attack, where he was able to consistently battle and fend off blockers who were much bigger than him. He plays with excellent contact balance and is almost never on the ground. His arms are short for the position at the NFL level and his overall mass is below average for an interior player, but he rarely looks overwhelmed by his opponent‚Äôs power or double teams. Johnson is a consistently productive interior prospect, but his lack of physical traits is likely to limit his draft slotting and will potentially force teams to see if he can continue adding weight to his frame without slowing down.",5.85,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/desjuan-johnson/32004a4f-4820-2189-6e26-1076b497c1d2
Gervarrius Owens,"Owens has the physical ingredients to play safety. The mistakes he put on tape should be a concern, though. His cornerback background shows with the way he matches route breaks from man coverage, but he lacks the field vision and instincts to become a consistent playmaker from man or zone. Owens is a willing and physical hitter, but he takes suspect angles to the football and has too many missed tackles after the catch and in run support. He has draftable traits, but the issues might be a difficult fix.",5.85,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gervarrius-owens/32004f57-4543-2476-38e7-474f1c8856c7
Jarrett Patterson,"Compact center/guard prospect with adequate run-blocking talent but athletic limitations that create concerns in protection. Patterson‚Äôs short arms are mitigated by efficient, accurate hand strikes and an ability to stay connected to his run blocks. He might not shine individually, but he works effectively with teammates on double teams. He has good contact balance and rarely gets cheated with the firmness of his first contact. Patterson‚Äôs feet aren‚Äôt as quick as his eyes, which is apparent when he‚Äôs forced to deal with redirecting against athletic rushers. He‚Äôs scheme-dependent and needs to prove he has the functional athleticism to win more than he loses.",5.85,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jarrett-patterson/32005041-5445-7456-8c72-5fc60a8decb0
Chris Rodriguez Jr.,"Rodriguez is a powerful runner, but he lacks the burst and creativity to become anything more than a downhill grinder. He has the size and mentality to do the dirty work between the tackles, but it could be a challenge for him to get to and through the hole quickly in the NFL. He‚Äôs a physical blitz protector, so teams might envision a role for him as a second-half battering ram and third-down quarterback protector.",5.85,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-rodriguez-jr/3200524f-4479-7090-bc9d-40ffbbc0f4c6
Princeton Fant,"Fant should be viewed as an NFL H-back capable of competing for a roster spot with teams willing to think outside the box. He‚Äôs too small to play tight end and isn‚Äôt a classic lead-blocking fullback, but he‚Äôs intriguing, nonetheless. Fant‚Äôs athleticism could enable him to create headaches as a route runner for linebackers, and he‚Äôs a tough runner after the catch. His hands are subpar, and his blocking can be hit-or-miss, which are obvious hindrances at this time. Keep an eye on his ability as a short-yardage option, as he flashed natural talent in that area in very limited carries for the Vols.",5.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/princeton-fant/32004641-4e40-6852-9aae-790b49a51e60
Antoine Green,"Green‚Äôs size and deep-ball success make him a more intriguing Day 3 prospect than the overall production and skill set might suggest. Like most vertical specialists, he‚Äôs not going to shake man coverage on intermediate routes, but he has decent hands and consistently finds himself overtaking deep coverage with his build-up speed. He might find himself fighting for a spot on a practice squad or the back end of a roster.",5.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/antoine-green/32004752-4506-2049-c884-39c1e1941fd8
Jovaughn Gwyn,"Gwyn is a solid football player, but his lack of size and length is a major hindrance relative to staying at guard. He‚Äôll likely need to prove he can snap and play center, where he will still be considered undersized. He‚Äôs a tenacious run blocker who can operate in multiple schemes but might not be able to shine in any of them. Gwyn plays with a firm base and good body control in protection but lacks the length and range to consistently protect gaps. Gwyn will be a one-position player, but he has enough talent and technique to compete for a roster spot at center.",5.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jovaughn-gwyn/32004757-5941-5291-b151-cb1bde0e7da3
Nic Jones,"Jones is a long cornerback with average speed but a natural feel for making plays on the football. He‚Äôs more confident and consistent at maintaining his feel for the route from press than from off-man. Jones plays with a lane-jumping mentality in off coverage when flat-footed but could succumb to double moves in the pros. Shoddy tackling will work against him, but teams will appreciate his ability to challenge punts and kicks off the edge. Jones might find work as a backup in a press-heavy scheme if he tests well.",5.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nic-jones/32004a4f-4e63-6725-c7e7-205da89b1116
Ivan Pace Jr.,"A rare blend of leverage, toughness and tackle obsession makes Pace‚Äôs tape a fun day of film study. He might be one of the strongest players in the 2023 NFL Draft from a pound-for-pound standpoint. He‚Äôs able to slip and club blockers out of the way with lower-body anchor and elite contact balance. He was cleared to take shots downhill by the defense, which bolstered his production, but his instincts and feel for finding routes to the ball seem to drive him. It is hard not to love Pace's game tape, but his lack of length and speed could create inconsistencies at the next level.",5.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ivan-pace-jr/32005041-4322-7420-e151-cbb8330c9baa
Nesta Jade Silvera,"Interior plugger set for duties as a nose tackle in a 4-3 front. Silvera is fairly nimble and can get into blockers quickly. He plays with knockback power and can hold his ground against single blockers. He struggles to feel and respond to down blocks. Also, he has trouble reading and reacting to lateral steps looking to seal him behind the play. Silvera has talent and is very active. He could make noise in camp as a late-round pick or priority free agent.",5.84,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nesta-jade-silvera/32005349-4c70-1377-3876-3fd27dd61a2c
Jakorian Bennett,"High-cut cornerback who is more of a catch-challenger than an instinctive ballhawk. The high passes defensed total is an example of how aggressive Bennett is at the catch point, and he‚Äôs clearly effective at tilting the 50/50 ball in his favor. However, his coverage tends to lack the needed anticipation and discipline to stay connected to NFL route runners. He has good size, but his coverage strength is a mix and match of man and zone with both featuring inconsistencies that will likely follow him into an NFL camp.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jakorian-bennett/32004245-4e35-1736-3c9a-75895b4e9970
Mekhi Blackmon,"Aggressive man-cover cornerback whose physical play brings both passes defensed and penalties. Blackmon gives receivers a rough ride over the first five yards, but his extended grabbing will be less tolerated by NFL officials. He‚Äôs capable of phasing routes when matching from press, but he doesn‚Äôt have the hips to transition smoothly when playing off-man coverage. He‚Äôs talented at squeezing the catch space and timing his challenges, but Blackmon‚Äôs lack of size and fluidity could limit his pro chances.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mekhi-blackmon/3200424c-4128-9825-2a67-246736ad314a
Jacob Copeland,"Explosive athlete with NFL size and traits but lacking an NFL skill set at the position. Copeland clearly has the athletic profile of an NFL wideout and that will make him worthy of attention. His production has been average, though, and his tape does not always inspire. Copeland is missing the instincts and route acumen to set up his breaks and elude coverage. The physical profile gives him a shot, but he will need to impress in camp to garner a roster opportunity.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacob-copeland/3200434f-5035-6703-9078-552ccef448d3
Demario Douglas,"Smallish slot receiver with adequate speed and quickness but inconsistent route running and ball skills. Douglas has the ability to slip press and can be a tough route-runner for defenses to read, but he needs to get better at the finer points of the craft to separate from NFL coverage. He won‚Äôt be a plus ball-winner on contested catches, but he can make challenging grabs. Douglas has late-round potential but his lack of size and history of muffed punts could work against him.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demario-douglas/3200444f-5525-9552-5dc9-fda7c5a9b03d
Payne Durham,"Durham possesses the measurables of a Y tight end, with the ability to compete as a blocker both in-line and on the move. He still needs to add play strength as a run blocker, though. Durham lacks the speed to threaten the seam and the functional agility to beat coverage underneath. He‚Äôs been fairly involved in the Purdue passing game and has a chance to make a team as a run-blocking tight end with the potential to make tough catches.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/payne-durham/32004455-5234-4537-ada8-3aff70e4440c
Brandon Joseph,"Joseph has adequate size and a good football IQ, but he must prove he can become a more technically sound tackler for consideration as an interchangeable safety. He sees the field fairly clearly as a free safety. He has the ball skills and instincts to help coral and challenge action in front of him. While he can be a punishing hitter when running the alley, tackling inconsistencies in the open field could be hard for teams to overlook. Joseph's traits and special teams talent give him the opportunity to battle for a backup safety spot as a Day 3 selection.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-joseph/32004a4f-5315-2803-1e18-a4e3e436c851
Aubrey Miller Jr.,Miller is patient but ready when keying the action and uses his anticipatory skills to help him stay cleaner than most undersized inside ‚Äòbackers. He aims to punish as a striker and is a capable open-field tackler when plays head outside the tackle box. He‚Äôs nothing special in coverage but displays the potential to become a plus special-teamer.,5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aubrey-miller-jr/32004d49-4c62-5910-2fe1-00d345d70461
Trey Palmer,"Former five-star recruit who made a name for himself at Nebraska after leaving LSU. Palmer‚Äôs route running is raw, but coachable. He‚Äôs an athletic mover with good leaping ability and a quiet engine that can unleash a big second gear to chase the deep throw. Getting Palmer to play to his top speed and with a consistent competitiveness will be the challenge, as his ball skills are below average. The athleticism and speed will be tempting on Day 3, but his upside could be limited.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-palmer/32005041-4c68-3280-9744-beeaa584121e
Christian Sims,"Sims is an undersized tight end who will give it a go as a blocker but is not strong enough or technically sound enough to handle in-line or lead-blocking duties. He‚Äôs a talented athlete who has the acceleration to uncover versus man coverage, the speed to threaten the over the top of linebackers and the talent to create after the catch. The lack of a clean positional fit limits his opportunities, but there is clearly talent to mold.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-sims/32005349-4d66-9861-90cd-241f77bf44f5
Brenton Cox Jr.,"Former five-star recruit whose dismissals from both Georgia and Florida could hurt his draft stock. On the field, Cox is a linear attacker with heavy hands and the ability to effectively stack and shed blocks. While he has some bend-and-dip athleticism as a rusher, he‚Äôs primarily a brute-force attacker currently lacking the game plan or counters to beat offensive tackles possessing a quality anchor. He needs more technique work across the board but has the traits to create advantages for himself on the field. He has the potential to slot in as a rotational 3-4 outside 'backer, but he needs to convince teams the issues that led to his dismissals from Georgia and Florida won't resurface in the NFL.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brenton-cox-jr/3200434f-5814-7946-7cff-ba2c7ec73aae
Derius Davis,"TCU found ways to get the ball into Davis‚Äô hands in an efficient manner, allowing him to make explosive plays with his speed. While he still carries that value on the pro level, his ability to slip press and cut with quickness could foreshadow a more robust opportunity as an NFL slot receiver. He is capable of running a more complex route tree in the future and should offer immediate competition as a punt returner.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derius-davis/32004441-5626-3132-bab0-4f5a3b5e1671
Mekhi Garner,"Garner is a big, long corner with a jarring press. However, he‚Äôs missing the footwork and body control to phase and match NFL routes that force him to change direction. He‚Äôs a handful when he‚Äôs in position to challenge the throw, but teams might need to plug him into a Cover 2 scheme or try him at safety, where he can help support the run and cover tight ends.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mekhi-garner/32004741-5230-5959-43fa-ef34fae3b675
Thomas Incoom,"Incoom is a tight-hipped, short-stepping edge defender whose lack of ideal length could push him into a full-time role as a 3-4 outside linebacker. His upper-body strength and sturdy base allow him to neutralize bigger men across from him, but he‚Äôs unlikely to ever be a volume playmaker or tackler. His face-up rushing style is neither elusive nor particularly creative, and many of his sacks over the last two seasons have come thanks to his strong, secondary effort. Incoom was average against tackles from Oklahoma State and Penn State in 2022, but there are enough flashes on tape to warrant a look on Day 3 of the draft.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/thomas-incoom/3200494e-4348-5869-a898-f9df3b757973
Malik Knowles,"Perimeter receiver with adequate measurables and above-average value as a kick returner. Knowles is an angular route runner who is much more effective on longer-developing routes that allow him to win with tempo through turns. Lacking suddenness, he will struggle beating press and uncovering underneath. He requires a runway to find his speed on run-after-catch throws. Knowles is athletic and smooth as a pass-catcher but might be limited to a role as a potential WR5/6 with kick return value.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malik-knowles/32004b4e-4f36-8096-16f9-b8375c41f3c4
Scott Matlock,"Matlock might fit best as a 4i or five-technique, where he can avoid interior blockers a little more often while activating his motor and athleticism. He‚Äôs not going to be a consistent block-beater or take on double teams unless he‚Äôs able to get bigger and stronger, but he does show flashes as a rusher and as a penetrator against the run. He could have late-round value.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/scott-matlock/32004d41-5434-7280-23b6-4ee735a3fae9
Derek Parish,"Parish is an active, full-steam-ahead edge defender, but his short arms will be detrimental in helping him get away from blockers, both as a run defender and pass rusher. His body type, toughness and knockback mentality make him a strong candidate to transition to the fullback position. Parish might not hear his name called during the draft, but his special teams potential gives him a solid chance to make a team.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derek-parish/32005041-5208-8504-7c81-6a9ec6df5c9f
SaRodorick Thompson Jr.,"Thompson possesses several pieces of the puzzle, but they fail to create a consistent product on the field. He‚Äôs tough and strong, but he would benefit from a more aggressive approach. Indecisiveness and dancing will cost him yardage against faster, more talented fronts in the NFL. He‚Äôll likely need to show he can get downhill and utilize his power to finish if he‚Äôs going to stick on an NFL roster. Thompson has limited special teams experience, but he has the demeanor to contribute via that phase of the game. If he can test well, the measurables and ability to play on multiple downs could give him an advantage in a battle for a roster spot.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sarodorick-thompson-jr/32005448-4f68-2353-2877-14470a6e8644
Grant DuBose,"Raw receiving prospect with just two years of major college experience under his belt. DuBose possesses NFL size with an expansive catch radius. He‚Äôs talented at winning fade routes and jump balls, but he struggles to win in the early stages of the route against press and tight man coverage. DuBose is still in the learning stages but already displays some route talent. A lack of separation quickness could make his battle for a roster spot more challenging.",5.81,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/grant-dubose/32004455-4259-9865-da28-e02ea4e66ba6
Connor Galvin,"Finesse run blocker with agility, foot quickness and a feel for angles to carry his zone-scheme experience into the pros. Galvin is a scheme-specific blocker due to his lack of drive power and in-line block sustain. He might find that teams prefer him as an interior blocker due to his lack of desired arm length. He has plenty of body control and athleticism to pass protect against active pass rushers, but his lack of edge firmness and core strength will be a concern when he‚Äôs forced to match up against bull rushers. Galvin should offer both swing tackle and guard value, which should bolster his draft stock.",5.81,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/connor-galvin/32004741-4c78-6490-1d09-90fd1c669897
Kazmeir Allen,"Smallish speedster who will need to prove to NFL evaluators that he is more than just a gadget option. Despite his explosiveness, Allen scored just 11 touchdowns on offense during his UCLA career, as his primary duties were of the catch-and-run variety underneath. He‚Äôs not a very effective route-runner, but his acceleration and agility could help change that if he keeps working on technique. His speed and open-field potential could create an opportunity for him.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kazmeir-allen/3200414c-4c53-2573-b419-a2502157ad7f
Habakkuk Baldonado,"Even-front defensive end with decent play strength, good lateral movement and an average motor in attacking the line of scrimmage. Baldonado has adequate power to brace and set edges but lacks urgency to get to the ball and make plays. Similarly, he flashes skill as a pass rusher but seems too content to go where the rush takes him rather than countering and recalibrating his attack of the pocket. He has the size and traits for the position but needs a motor than runs hotter to become a rotational player in the pros.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/habakkuk-baldonado/32004241-4c23-1813-c38d-a9f03986c065
SirVocea Dennis,"Dennis is willing to take chances, which can lead to feast or famine results. He‚Äôs a smart player with outstanding play recognition and instincts that help him play faster than his timed speed. He‚Äôll beat blockers to the spot on plays flowing over the offensive tackle, but he‚Äôs unable to withstand a downhill challenge from climbing blocks on a consistent enough basis. Dennis‚Äô special teams potential aids his chances of becoming an NFL backup, but he doesn‚Äôt have size or athleticism that stands out and needs to put together a solid pre-draft workout.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sirvocea-dennis/32004445-4e40-2506-bf9a-7ab7dce4da04
Xavier Gipson,Slot receiver whose best work comes after the ball is in his hands as both a pass-catcher and punt returner. Gipson possesses average size but good speed and demonstrates the vision and early acceleration to create explosive plays in the open field. He‚Äôs not a very accomplished route runner and takes the worst of it on 50/50 balls. His ability to make it as a pro could be tied directly to his ability to uncover as a catch-and-run option and to thrive as a return man.,5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xavier-gipson/32004749-5057-6222-78ba-a836b095e2d2
Jake Haener,"Team captain with below-average size and arm talent, but above-average football IQ. Haener plays with a pre-snap plan and does a nice job of getting the ball out quickly against the blitz. He senses edge pressure and slides to find a new location to throw from. He doesn‚Äôt have the drive velocity to successfully window shop and might require a timing-based scheme or spread attack where he can make quick throws in rhythm. Haener‚Äôs lack of traits, coupled with limited mobility outside the pocket, create a challenging road to NFL success.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-haener/32004841-4535-1032-5335-81e19a8e5996
DeMarcco Hellams,Boundary safety with good size and adequate anticipation but a lack of quality make-up burst when beaten over the top. Hellams can cover tight ends and is comfortable in split zone looks but needs to do a much better job of staying deeper than the deepest target. He‚Äôs fairly consistent as a tackler but doesn‚Äôt always take the most efficient routes to the ball. He‚Äôs physical and can play high or low. Hellams has a chance to become a good backup and plus special teams player.,5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/demarcco-hellams/32004845-4c25-6639-ebe9-aca7398e1c11
Evan Hull,"Compact, muscular runner with below-average explosiveness but decent downhill power. Hull‚Äôs lack of suddenness and foot quickness to quickly get in and out of cuts allows defenders to track him down. He needs to play with as much downhill movement as possible, so he will need a quality offensive line in front of him to succeed. He‚Äôs a very capable route-runner and pass-catcher but he needs to improve in pass protection for consideration as a third-down option. Hull might need the perfect team fit to stick around on a roster long-term.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/evan-hull/32004855-4c08-4697-e160-3c4a9d8ca5e2
Amare Jones,Slot receiver whose background with option football and as a returner could increase his chances with teams seeking versatility. Jones is a fluid athlete with the footwork to handle short to intermediate routes.

Will Mallory,"Move tight end with good build-up speed and adequate athleticism as a route runner. Mallory‚Äôs production was often set up by play-action and rub routes, but he has the potential to find catches on his own. He needs to play with better aggression and strength to not only own the catch space but handle run-blocking duties when called upon. Mallory has an opportunity to fight for a TE3 roster spot but competition could be tight.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-mallory/32004d41-4c45-4836-6518-ce6369c07a94
Carlton Martial,"The first thing a team will need to do is consider Martial‚Äôs lack of size and what it will mean for his fit on the roster. He‚Äôs very small but appears extremely tough and competitive. He plays the game with a nice balance of elusiveness and aggression when taking on blocks. He has the burst and instincts to rack up high tackle totals, but he lacks the tackle radius and size to ensure consistency and to play in the box full time. Martial will likely need to prove himself in coverage, as teams will pigeonhole him as a box safety with nickel/dime linebacker value.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carlton-martial/32004d41-5249-8704-3695-c9a0547a29c0
Tanner McKee,"Long, tall pocket passer with better arm strength than arm talent as a passer. McKee throws with an unorthodox delivery that becomes even more irregular when he feels rushed. He can make all the NFL throws and delivers a tight spiral with good velocity on intermediate and deep throws to the field side. However, his heavy feet and a lack of agility limit his effectiveness outside of the pocket and make him a magnet for pass rushers when protection becomes spotty. McKee clearly improved his throwing process in 2022, but he might lack the decision-making and functional mobility to make it in today‚Äôs NFL.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tanner-mckee/32004d43-4b15-6404-8b65-d2cfdf887c42
Puka Nacua,"Nacua is an athletic wideout lacking the twitch or speed to attack NFL man coverage at a successful rate. However, the ball skills and competitive nature he brings to the field give him a fighting chance to make a roster. He might need to be used as a possession receiver operating from the slot, where his ball-winning and size can work in his favor. He‚Äôs sneaky talented with the ball in his hands, so jet-sweep work in the pros could be an option. He has a shot to be picked on Day 3. There are make-it elements in the way he plays the game.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/puka-nacua/32004e41-4355-9347-35af-af88fcaf7ee9
Robert Soderholm III,"A full-time snapper for four years, Soderholm is a high-energy teammate. He‚Äôs short for the position but strong and has the athleticism to make tackles in space. His size could hurt him in the eyes of some teams, but his accuracy and consistency give him a chance to make an NFL roster.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/robert-soderholm-iii/3200534f-4442-6541-df53-ec1c2b45c5cc
Sidy Sow,"Sow has played a high number of snaps during his time at Eastern Michigan. Despite the starting experience, he struggles to find proper angles in the running game and respond to blitzes/twists in pass protection. While he could continue to improve and has some physical traits to work with, making a roster will be an uphill climb.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sidy-sow/3200534f-5704-4268-3a10-28073084590f
Charlie Thomas,"Thomas is undersized but slippery with an ability to slink through crevices and get pads on ball-carriers. He has average instincts and struggles to fight off blocks. He‚Äôs not expected to be a burner when testing and doesn‚Äôt look to have great coverage quickness, but he seems to find a burst when racing laterally to get in on the tackle. His lack of functional size will be hard for teams to overlook on draft day, but Thomas‚Äô production and feel for the game might override size concerns for some teams.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/charlie-thomas/32005448-4f08-6194-3325-0185cc5cce94
Michael Turk,"Like a home run hitter in baseball, Turk has tremendous power but is lacking ball control to plant opposing teams against their end zone instead of kicking for touchbacks. He has improved his hang-time and outkicked his coverage a little less frequently, which will matter for NFL evaluators. The pure power and talent could get him a Day 3 look.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-turk/32005455-5206-5453-d33e-d486b96be9fa
Josh Vann,"Vann has played inside and outside; he could end up doing the same as a pro. He ran well at his pro day, but his play speed can be inconsistent on tape. He has average size and strength. Also, he relies on athletic ability over positioning savvy to battle for contested catches. The production was fairly average at South Carolina, but his testing and 2021 tape could play to his favor.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-vann/32005641-4e62-7556-b377-899e7c0c6745
Dalton Wagner,"Wagner has rare size and length at the tackle position, with much better play strength than we typically see from tackles of his height. He uses his long arms to punch with independent hands, using well-timed strikes to keep rushers out of rhythm. A lack of foot agility leaves him susceptible to inside moves and counters both as a pass protector and run blocker. His overall ability in pass pro plays to his favor, but the run blocking is subpar. Wagner is a right tackle-only prospect but pass protection is very valuable in the league, which gives him a chance to make a roster.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dalton-wagner/32005741-4729-9930-f1c0-9646730f5661
Alan Ali,"Ali has limited size and length, but he plays with good consistency and the fortitude to give himself a chance in the league. Very quickly, the tape shows off his body control and core strength, which help him stay connected to blocks through adversity. A lack of length will put him in a hole against long-armed tackles, and he will need help handling odd front nose tackles. The pass protection is inconsistent and could stay that way due to a lack of physical traits. He might not get drafted, but he could surprise in a camp.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alan-ali/3200414c-4901-4831-8889-000a5bea3703
Trey Dean III,"Big, long safety with good athleticism and toughness but a lack of top-end speed. He needs to play with better patience early in the rep and must become more aware of his assignment responsibilities. While he lacked speed in his NFL Scouting Combine testing, he did show the ability to run with downfield targets on tape. Dean can cover big tight ends and help support the run in the box but spotty angles to the tackle plague him at times. Dean will have to compete to make a team as a down safety who can shine on special teams.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-dean-iii/32004445-4172-9701-c6c1-d1ebb82ce6bd
Travis Dye,"Instinctive runner with modest size who finds ways to squeeze the most he can out of almost every run. Dye runs with the pace, vision and change-of-direction talent to dart through run lanes and he resets his travel plans according to the flow of the defense. He‚Äôs efficient but lacked functional speed and explosiveness in his pro-day testing. Dye's third-down value helps his chances, but he might have to fight for a spot as an undrafted free agent.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-dye/32004459-4525-6368-cb85-619138146a89
Tiyon Evans,"Low-cut back with a muscular frame and an unpolished running style. Evans is ready to charge ahead and find the action on every snap, but he needs to run with better tempo and patience to allow his blocks to develop. He has sudden feet and good burst as both an inside and outside runner. He also has the contact balance to keep runs alive. His vision and feel for setting up blocks isn‚Äôt great, though. Evans‚Äô lack of third down value and special teams experience will make it more challenging for him to earn a RB3 spot.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tiyon-evans/32004556-4179-2558-a255-41c425f85971
Noah Gindorff,"Gindorff has below average pass-catching and athletic traits for the tight end position, but plenty of potential as a blocker. His hand placement and footwork are both technically sound and he plays with some vinegar in his game as a sustain and finish blocker. Gindorff‚Äôs medicals will be critical for his opportunities moving forward. If those evaluations check out, teams might be deciding between playing him as a Y tight end or attempting to pack weight on his frame to try him as an offensive tackle.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/noah-gindorff/32004749-4e13-8429-2918-2afa12240214
Shaka Heyward,"Heyward is a long-armed run-and-hit linebacker who will not be cheated as a wrap-up tackler. He‚Äôs eager to find the action but can be inconsistent recognizing play development and getting into proper positioning, whether he‚Äôs a run defender or in coverage. Teams will like the body type and physicality that are part of the package, and being a plus special teams performer can only help his cause.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaka-heyward/32004845-5927-7986-59f2-11ab553226ec
Jordan Howden,"Howden is a football-savvy free safety with good instincts and play recognition but a lack of acceleration, which could create a plethora of problems for him on the pro level. He‚Äôs quick to diagnose the run, but will need to improve his tackle technique. A lack of recovery juice could get him mismatched on the pro game, but he sees route combinations well when allowed to play as a two-deep safety. Howden has played a lot of football and can help on special teams but needs to prove himself as a tester at the NFL Scouting Combine.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-howden/3200484f-5749-3327-f45c-e3a9b981208f
Rakim Jarrett,"Jarrett is a slot receiver with an excellent build, plus speed and good athleticism, but he's missing necessary ingredients to succeed at the position. It doesn‚Äôt take long to see the physical gifts on tape, but Jarrett‚Äôs lack of route-running fundamentals and ball skills catch up with him too often. His tape is filled with slants, digs and quick-game throws; he struggles to manipulate defenders with his routes and comes out on the wrong end when throws are contested. He‚Äôs a better athlete than receiver as he enters the draft, but he does have athletic tools for cultivation if a team can get it done.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rakim-jarrett/32004a41-5226-0842-1591-c4d0d04d4b30
Michael Jefferson,"Jefferson is a tall target with build-up speed and a receiving style that gets better the further he gets from the line. He doesn‚Äôt have the short-area quickness to elude NFL press effectively and could struggle to uncover against tight man coverage over the first two levels. He has decent ball skills and works into the zones effectively, but he will have a challenging time making an NFL roster.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-jefferson/32004a45-4628-6113-d0db-4082411751de
Andre Jones Jr.,"Long-limbed edge defender with an angular frame and a willingness to take on all comers. Jones‚Äô production might not jump off the page, but he‚Äôs athletic and uses his length to put himself in position to make tackles. Jones could use more strength in his lower half both as a run defender and pass rusher. While they aren‚Äôt sustained, there are flashes of rush potential that might create a roster opportunity after a year on a practice squad.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-jones-jr/32004a4f-4e82-6252-1498-29b93a10dfc9
Isaiah Land,"Historically, a player with Land‚Äôs lack of mass and length would face an uphill battle trying to make it as a 3-4 outside linebacker in the NFL, but his ability to threaten the pocket should generate interest from teams. Land is a very natural, instinctive rusher with the get-off, counters and fluidity to stress some tackles. He doesn‚Äôt have enough sand in his pants to hold up against the run and teams might try him as a 4-3 outside linebacker with sub-package rush ability off the edge. Land might need a year or two on a practice squad to continue to develop.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-land/32004c41-4e02-8469-5ae3-22775d6dba98
Titus Leo,"Edge defender prospect with long arms, an explosive first punch and room for improvement as a pass rusher. Leo goes hard into first contact and can separate from blocks fairly quickly, but he‚Äôs tight-hipped, lacking the bend and the base strength to hold up against power at the point of attack. He challenges the pocket with a variety of rush angles, but his get-off and hand work might not yet be good enough to impress NFL evaluators. Leo might need seasoning on a practice squad.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/titus-leo/32004c45-4f23-9780-24d3-914b5ff1561e
Johnny Lumpkin,"Lumpkin‚Äôs size and length will have some teams taking a close look to see if there is enough on tape to develop him as a heavy-handed Y tight end or even transition him inside to tackle. He is a decent blocker at the point of attack, with the traits and willingness to improve in that area. However, he‚Äôs unlikely to be much more than an occasional pass target sneaking out on play-action throws. His physical traits give him a chance to find a home on a practice squad while he continues to develop.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/johnny-lumpkin/32004c55-4d32-7732-f8d2-b738b15043ed
Isaiah Moore,"It‚Äôs hard to watch the tape and not love Moore‚Äôs game. He‚Äôs an inside linebacker with a throwback body type and intangibles that are off-the-charts. He plays with excellent instincts and recognition, showing little hesitation to run and hit. Unfortunately, a lack of functional speed limits his range and ability to handle coverage duties. He‚Äôs more than capable between the tackles as a 3-4 inside ‚Äòbacker but must prove he can hold up in a faster game at the next level.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-moore/32004d4f-4f37-8492-dc0a-71fe9e0c9614
Caleb Murphy,"An edge defender with adequate size and skill, Murphy will need to prove his gaudy production can translate into an opportunity to make plays on the professional level. He dominated Division II competition with stat lines that are inconceivable. However, his rush appeared to lack power and unpredictability when matched against better opponents during his week at the East-West Shrine Bowl. He plays with average explosiveness but a quality motor and could create buzz in the future if he can become a more diverse and skilled rusher.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/caleb-murphy/32004d55-5218-6262-c4e2-7739045c2a95
Cam Peoples,"Well-schooled zone-scheme back with good size but ordinary skills at the position. It‚Äôs commendable that he keeps runs on track and is willing to trust his line, but the game film shows a lack of creativity and escapability. With little production as a pass-catcher, Peoples will need to run with better bend and become a more aggressive run finisher to compete for a roster spot as a pro.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-peoples/32005045-4f26-1111-2448-c872f51ce13d
Nikko Remigio,"Slot receiver and return specialist who stands out more with the ball in his hands than as a natural separator on routes. Fresno State‚Äôs offense did a nice job of finding creative ways to get the ball in Remigio‚Äôs hands and he paid them back with a consistent ability to find yardage. He could struggle to uncover over the first two levels against NFL man coverage, but he has talent as a quick-game option who can handle return duties.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nikko-remigio/32005245-4d24-0921-f4ca-9b409d7391a3
Dorian Thompson-Robinson,"Five-year starter with below-average size, above-average mobility and a recent history of improvement at the position. Thompson-Robinson played in a favorable scheme for quarterbacks, but he also improved as a field-reader over time. While he can extend plays and create opportunities for himself outside of the pocket, he‚Äôs at his best when he‚Äôs throwing on time and utilizing possession throws as his base. He has lapses in vision and judgment against zone and when pressured, so he must cut down on ill-advised throws. Thompson-Robinson has the potential to find a home as a QB3 with a QB2 ceiling.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dorian-thompson-robinson/32005448-4f74-4868-ca39-079204531939
Tyrus Wheat,"Wheat, a three-year starter for Mississippi State, offers decent versatility and good play strength. He has the physicality to go toe-to-toe at the point of attack, but he is lacking football instincts to anticipate and make more plays. Wheat tends to play from Point A to Point B instead of consistently reading and engaging as the play develops. He might benefit from a clearly defined role in a defense with more structure than the one he played in for the Bulldogs. His ability to drop in space or play with power could help him earn a spot as a backup 3-4 strong-side linebacker with special teams value.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyrus-wheat/32005748-4503-4607-6d7b-0ec04985eabf
Brayden Willis,"Willis‚Äô size and athletic profile leaves him lacking as both an in-line blocker and as a pass-catching option. He lacks in-line power and plays with low-burn intensity getting into blocks at times, but body control and hand strength help increase his sustain effectiveness when blocking on the move. He‚Äôs tough working into traffic, but a high percentage of his catches came with nobody around him in space. He will need to prove he can separate against man coverage outside of the Oklahoma scheme.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brayden-willis/32005749-4c59-7331-d2e9-d4e09be28c28
Tyson Bagent,"Highly decorated and highly confident Division II quarterback with adequate NFL size but mechanical issues that need to be cleaned up. Bagent‚Äôs footwork can become erratic under pressure and his delivery is reminiscent of a shortstop‚Äôs throw to first base at times. He plays with a good feel for his offensive design and a willingness to attack all intermediate pockets of the field regardless of cover scheme. However, the decision-making and arm strength might not be good enough to beat the window-shopping defensive backs of the NFL.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyson-bagent/32004241-4756-5656-dc05-96cbcc86cf60
Jalen Brooks,"Brooks was not granted eligibility by the NCAA until the fifth game of the 2020 season and he stepped away from the South Carolina program for the second half of the 2021 season. Those missed games help explain his limited college production, but his 2022 game film -- when he started 12 games -- failed to stand out. However, his play strength and ball skills are clearly noticeable on tape. He‚Äôs a high-cut, leggy route runner who struggles to outmaneuver coverage getting in and out of breaks. He‚Äôs highly competitive on 50/50 balls and has run-after-catch talent to have his moments in the open field, but his poor speed testing at the NFL Scouting Combine could be tough for him to overcome.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jalen-brooks/32004252-4f12-4672-48a0-d6175dc0568c
Emari Demercado,"Demercado is a well-built runner who plays with good balance through contact. He has the ability to finish with forward lean. His vision and operation time are just average, which limits his ability to rip off chunk runs, but he does a nice job of getting what is there. His kick-return experience and third-down potential could give him a slight advantage if he goes head-to-head for the RB4 spot on a roster.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/emari-demercado/32004445-4d31-7794-7d50-f20a6d3e35eb
Trevor Downing,"Downing is not big or strong enough to root out block-eaters and is an average athlete as it pertains to move-blocking duties, but he knows where he needs to be and is generally in the right place at the right time. There won‚Äôt be anything that stands out about his game, but the tape is fairly solid and he should get a look in an NFL camp.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevor-downing/3200444f-5764-4689-a60a-1e523c1c4abe
Ikenna Enechukwu,"Enechukwu clearly has the frame and length to garner attention as a developmental prospect, but his lack of fluidity and athleticism could require a move inside. With additional size, he‚Äôs tough enough to play as a 3-4 end. He flashes bull-rush potential and good upper-body strength to build on, but the skill set needs further development for him to have a solid chance in the NFL.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ikenna-enechukwu/3200454e-4520-7645-bd71-4829b8b6fa34
Tyreque Jones,"Box safety featuring good size and closing speed but a lack of fluidity to hold up to man-coverage duties as a pro. Jones plays with good toughness and a willingness to mix it up near the line of scrimmage. He‚Äôs capable in short zone coverage or against certain in-line tight ends, but he loses effectiveness when playing in reverse. Jones‚Äô extreme length will catch the attention of traits-hungry teams, but those same teams will face limitations in how they are able use him.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyreque-jones/32004a4f-4e77-0071-4953-d42575c1b51e
Jordan Mims,"Mims runs with solid vision and good toughness to find yardage that is on the field for him. He can make a defender miss in space, but he doesn‚Äôt possess the sudden acceleration to blaze through the line of scrimmage or stack multiple cuts and keep runs going without tacklers finding him. He has some talent as an interior runner but needs to pick up the pace and become a little more decisive early on. He has some pass protection ability but might not catch the ball well enough for third-down consideration, which could hurt his chances of making a team.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-mims/32004d49-4d63-2686-7a2a-1afd68065e46
Jake Moody,"Moody has just two seasons as a full-time kicker but he was a consistent performer who could pull the team to wins when the offense sputtered. He‚Äôs very reliable on kicks shorter than 40 yards but has been less consistent from longer distances. He‚Äôs capable on kickoffs and strikes the ball with consistency, so he should get a shot a chance to compete for a roster spot in camp.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-moody/32004d4f-4f00-8651-ef00-ae7240b95cc4
Alex Palczewski,"Palczewski has played his fair share of football games. The experience shows with his poise and understanding of assignments on each snap. He‚Äôs quick out of his stance and does a nice job of making blocks in space, but lacks the functional power to sustain blocks against power on a consistent basis. He needs to get bigger and stronger to stick around in the league.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-palczewski/32005041-4c12-5725-d14c-dd2fa06a64b3
Kyle Patterson,"On paper, Patterson has the size, strength and upside to become an in-line tight end on the next level. However, he‚Äôs missed a number of games over the last two years due to injury, so proving his durability will be the priority. He played in Air Force‚Äôs option attack, so he‚Äôs well-versed at angles; he just needs to work on his hand placement and drive-blocking moving forward. He can grab catches here and there, but his best chance to make a team will be with his run-blocking -- and by maintaining his health.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-patterson/32005041-5446-9506-6fbe-5633a4473fbe
Deneric Prince,"Prince has the size and power to capture the attention of evaluators, but he needs to run like a power back on a more frequent basis. He runs with average vision and below-average burst, so becoming a decisive downhill back will be critical if he‚Äôs going to have a chance to make it on the next level.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deneric-prince/32005052-4948-2971-4589-5cd8f3fc56b0
Trevor Reid,"If the long-armed, high-cut offensive tackle is to have a chance in the league, it will be because of his pass-protection potential. Reid does a nice job of utilizing his length to punch and stay connected to rushers, but his lack of upper-body and hand strength are major liabilities at the point of attack and against power rushers. Reid is a decent athlete but needs to become much stronger in his core to improve his balance and body control. He appears to lack the polish to make an NFL roster early on but has some developmental traits that might warrant a stint on a practice squad.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trevor-reid/32005245-4937-2985-f147-1b2a9c9194eb
Ben Sims,"Tight end with average size and talent as a run blocker but the tools to get a little better in that area. Baylor frequently used Sims as a wingback who was asked to base block, lead block and get into space on outside zone. As a pass-catcher, he lacks separation talent and is going to get what is given to him by the defense. Sims‚Äô average traits mean he will likely need to be in a favorable situation to make a roster.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-sims/32005349-4d65-5854-d7e3-6273b550ed19
Keidron Smith,"Big, strong cornerback lacking top-end speed and an athletic lower half to stay connected with routes. Smith plays with physicality as his default. He has the demeanor and skills necessary to clean up the flanks as a run defender. He's not anticipatory enough for deep zone coverages at cornerback, but he might have a fighting chance to make a roster if he is utilized as a bump-and-sink Cover 2 corner or if he makes a transition to safety.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keidron-smith/3200534d-4945-0188-7514-30ebddbe37b7
BJ Thompson,"Thompson will garner attention with his outstanding athletic testing, but there is still a lot of physical and skill development that needs to take place. He doesn‚Äôt have enough strength to set firm edges and is unable to generate speed to power as a rusher. His long strides can be an effective weapon as a rusher and when in pursuit, but he needs to crank up his intensity and get bigger to play in the league.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bj-thompson/32005448-4f48-9203-afa4-755d18a8bfbb
Carrington Valentine,"Valentine has the physical traits necessary for the NFL but the instincts and body control to extend his coverage against quality route runners leaves something to be desired. He‚Äôs solid at crowding vertical throws and can play press-and-bail, but he has had coverage busts in zone. Also, he bites too easily on double moves. Valentine‚Äôs lack of aggression as a run defender could make it tougher for zone teams to give him a chance.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/carrington-valentine/32005641-4c32-6982-299a-6d8af31b45ab
Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu,"Powerful lineman whose lack of instincts and technique could make him a candidate for the practice squad as the jump-off point for his career. Aumavae-Laulu has the physical traits teams look for but lacks consistency with his hands and body composure getting into blocks. His odds of roster success will be much higher at the guard position, where he has enough athletic ability and power to potentially fit a wide variety of run schemes while creating better matchups for him in protection.",5.67,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malaesala-aumavae-laulu/32004155-4d07-0576-495f-c4b196f1bccb
Lance Boykin,"Long-legged, linear cornerback with the size and length to disrupt the catch point, but he lacks the athletic fluidity and short-area twitch to get there on time. Boykin will struggle to stay connected with NFL route runners as a man defender and lacks the desired long speed to prevent burners from flying by him. He‚Äôll need to play in a zone-based cover scheme and has the physical traits that could have teams trying him as a safety.",5.67,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lance-boykin/3200424f-5961-5392-b23b-8be87d179217
Jack Colletto,"Tenacious prospect willing to offer up whatever he can in order to find the field and help his team win. Colletto lacks ideal size and power to be a lead blocker and doesn‚Äôt have the length or burst teams look for at inside linebacker, but he can line up at either spot and perform at an adequate rate if needed. His demeanor and toughness make sense for special teams and he‚Äôs multifaceted for direct snaps and short-yardage packages as a quarterback. Colletto might not be drafted, but he will have a chance to compete for a spot in camp.",5.67,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jack-colletto/3200434f-4c39-2856-c9b2-2117910a1bc7
Luke Haggard,"Haggard will need to add mass and substantially more core strength if he is to have a real shot as a pro tackle. His technique and talent are fairly solid in both phases of his position. He‚Äôs more of a positional blocker than drive blocker, but he does have the body control to put up a fight as a run blocker. He‚Äôs short-armed for a tackle, but he has decent foot quickness and hip bend for recoveries. However, he‚Äôs frequently rolled into the pocket. NFL power rushers will defeat him unless he becomes stronger and has a much better anchor.",5.67,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/luke-haggard/32004841-4747-8445-b6b7-7ecc9482bd96
Lew Nichols III,"Early down back with good size and power. Nichols runs with solid vision and the ability to create yardage after contact, but he needs room to gain momentum and doesn‚Äôt have the wiggle to create for himself if the blocking falters. He‚Äôs smooth in his cuts, but he lacks the suddenness and play speed to stay a step ahead of NFL defenders. Nichols has an outside chance of making an NFL roster.",5.67,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/lew-nichols-iii/32004e49-4352-4830-b213-0722421ec562
Micah Baskerville,"Inside/outside linebacker prospect who falls short from a measurables standpoint but understands the game. Baskerville needs more strength, is a limited athlete and can be overtaken by blockers at times, but he plays with excellent pre- and post-snap recognition that leads him to the action. His football IQ and special teams background are important boxes for him to check, but he needs to test well to give himself a good chance of earning a roster spot.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/micah-baskerville/32004241-5325-3566-f740-f8cca4b8b7ef
Jarrick Bernard-Converse,"Bernard-Converse has spent a majority of his snaps as either an off-man or press-man cornerback, but he‚Äôll likely have to make a switch to safety in order to compete for a roster spot in the future. He‚Äôs big and strong, but he needs to become more of a run-through finisher than drag-down tackler. Sticky hips in transitions are a major concern relative to coverage tasks in space, and he fails to show the desired level of instincts he might need to range over the top as a pro.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jarrick-bernard-converse/32004245-5224-0672-7336-e3ddfa302832
Malik Cunningham,"Dual-threat quarterback who was much more effective as a runner than he was as a passer in 2022. Cunningham's build is slighter than teams typically like at quarterback, and his accuracy is spotty. He possesses premium running talent for zone-read and quarterback draws, and he can turn a lack of contain into a huge play with his legs. Teams will need to decide how Cunningham would fit into an offense, but his ability to make explosive plays with his legs should not be discounted.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malik-cunningham/32004355-4e53-7512-721a-d930b2a6e58f
Cameron Mitchell,"Mitchell provides good toughness and play strength but a lack of functional fluidity to stay connected with NFL route runners. His lack of length could be a problem against size and teams might consider bumping him inside to play the role of a run-defending nickel back. Mitchell is certainly fearless and might be better suited to play as a down safety with nickel potential against certain teams. He‚Äôs been an active tackler on punt and kick cover teams, which bolsters his chances of making a roster.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-mitchell/32004d49-5414-9749-5266-ae7585232540
Joseph Ngata,"Former five-star prospect with quality size, speed and length but an inability to separate from press-man coverage. Ngata is a smooth pass-catcher and has decent ball skills, but it takes him too long to elude press. When he gets into the route, it will be tough for him to uncover against NFL quickness and coverage talent.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joseph-ngata/32004e47-4163-4187-346b-55ed85d5120f
Alex Pihlstrom,"Former tight end who has added about 70 pounds to his frame during his career. He‚Äôs an average mover who lacks jolt getting into blocks but is consistent in latching in with his hands and finding his positioning. He knows how to play and has guard/center versatility, but he might lack the desired physicality and athletic ability for the next level.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-pihlstrom/32005049-4820-7645-67bc-5edf814db16f
Titus Swen,"Swen has offered steady rush production for Wyoming over the last two seasons despite possessing average size and play speed. He runs with patience and has the foot quickness to find his cuts quickly, but he needs to change his tempo more frequently to keep linebackers guessing. He‚Äôs a tough runner but doesn‚Äôt have the frame or power to batter NFL tacklers. Swen has attributes to work with, but a lack of third-down talent could make it tough for him to stick on a roster.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/titus-swen/32005357-4574-8021-5f6c-b6b98f88d5d5
Drake Thomas,"Good football player with a nose for the action and strong desire to make a play once he‚Äôs in the vicinity. Thomas‚Äô football acumen and execution are not issues, but his size, speed and length could be major hurdles to overcome. He‚Äôs physical in block take-on and instinctive to recognize play design, but playing around big blockers and chasing the action in space are likely to become larger issues for him as a pro.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/drake-thomas/32005448-4f11-9345-b166-f87d106ff4bb
Rashad Torrence II,"Free safety with adequate athleticism but a lack of top-end speed and explosiveness on tape. Torrence understands the game and has a safety‚Äôs feel for leverage and caution when needed. He‚Äôs generally around the action and in position, but he needs to become a much more consistent wrap-up tackler. He can be opportunistic but is unlikely to create ball production at a high level as a pro due to his lack of instincts and burst. Torrence‚Äôs athletic testing at the NFL Scouting Combine could force him to compete for a roster spot as an undrafted player.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashad-torrence-ii/3200544f-5269-4955-846e-142194cb85e8
Quinton Barrow,"Developmental project with good size and length. Barrow will require a tear down and rebuild from a technique standpoint. He is light on his feet, but he plays with a lack of bend and a base that is often too narrow. He won‚Äôt be much of a drive blocker due to his lack of leverage, but he does show the ability to get into outside space or up to the second level with some success. His pass protection isn‚Äôt good enough for pro ball yet, but he might get a chance to hang around on a practice squad for additional development.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quinton-barrow/32004241-5266-5032-9064-fea73255c0d7
Mohamoud Diabate,"Diabate is a physical tackler with a pretty good feel for sifting through the trash to find the ball between the tackles. However, when plays flow wide or he needs to play with agility and pursuit speed, the level of play consistency can take a tumble. The instincts and recognition are just average and he's a better rusher than cover man against the pass. Diabate has an outside shot of competing for a roster spot.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mohamoud-diabate/32004449-4102-5955-bffb-c3f37f323d4f
Cory Durden,"Durden was often stuck at a zero-technique nose tackle spot but is more likely to be considered as an even-front three-technique at the next level. His body control and contact balance are often spotty due to his upright playing style, but he finds ways to recover and get himself back in the play. He‚Äôs good at locating the football and hustles hard to chase the play down, but Durden lacks the ability to control the point of attack or consistently disrupt NFL blocking schemes.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cory-durden/32004455-5216-0046-7d4c-73aabdf637f2
Jaray Jenkins,"Jenkins has NFL size but lacks NFL suddenness, as well as the vertical speed to create separation that teams will want to see. He is constantly on glide mode when working around the field, and some of his route transitions can be effective from his smooth gait. However, NFL coverage will be quicker, more physical and often more anticipatory than at the college level, so expecting Jenkins to create necessary separation might be a stretch. He has the ball skills to grab contested catches, but there might be too many missing elements for him to stick around on a roster.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaray-jenkins/32004a45-4e26-8724-fb3a-d8d88bdb2bad
Noah Taylor,"Long-limbed 3-4 edge defender lacking the necessary play strength and anchor to take on NFL tackles right now. Taylor will struggle to set the edges consistently and hasn‚Äôt proven he can beat a quality Y tight end at the point of attack. He‚Äôs quick off the ball and has some juice/bend getting to the edge, but he will need to upgrade his hand skills and inside counters to threaten the pocket.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/noah-taylor/32005441-5960-9140-77e8-54af9fe7a1ca
Mitchell Tinsley,"Possession receiver lacking top-end speed and separation quickness but possessing quality ball skills. Tinsley‚Äôs lack of suddenness shows up quickly in press release and when trying to separate early in the route, but he‚Äôs very willing in the middle of the field and has terrific ball skills. He has the focus to make challenging catches at any spot on the field. He has good size and is a gamer, but a lack of athletic features might require him to play the role of zone-beater from the slot.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mitchell-tinsley/32005449-4e52-4900-5b74-358e5b5f449c
Xazavian Valladay,"Valladay runs a little bigger than his measured size, thanks to his decisive mindset and his acceleration into contact. He will get what is blocked and keep the play on the designed track, but he doesn‚Äôt have the change of direction or instincts to create for himself when it‚Äôs not blocked up. Valladay is competitive and productive, but he fails to stand out in any single area.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/xazavian-valladay/32005641-4c58-8531-2d65-4696020a7d12
Alex Ward,"Ward returned for a sixth collegiate season to work on his frame and his game in 2022. He added muscle mass and looked a little more athletic in his final collegiate campaign. He‚Äôs fairly consistent as a short snapper, but his long snaps come out with average speed and spiral to the target. He has a chance to be a late-round pick but will find a camp invite if he doesn‚Äôt hear his name called in the draft.",5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/alex-ward/32005741-5205-9977-2f78-00ad5bad8dbf
Jaylin Williams,Williams lacks the length and explosiveness of an outside corner but displayed his play strength and toughness at that position in the Big Ten. Williams has decent mirror-and-match footwork from press but can be a little late to accelerate quickly when forced to flip and chase. He plays with good recognition from zone and is quick to dart in on throws. His physical/athletic profile does not stand out and the lack of takeaways over the last two seasons could hurt him.,5.65,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylin-williams/32005749-4c35-4198-e160-e11a1670d799
Nate Adkins,"Adkins offers good play strength and tenacity as a point-of-attack blocker. He will need to improve his hand usage and play with better consistency to adjust on the move as a lead blocker. He will catch what is thrown to him and should be able to handle every phase of special teams. Adkins might go undrafted, but he has the toughness, frame and demeanor to warrant camp consideration as an NFL fullback.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nate-adkins/32004144-4b34-6075-d3fb-453dad04614a
Henry Bainivalu,"Guard-only prospect with NFL-caliber measurables but enough inconsistencies to cause concern. Bainivalu‚Äôs power is good enough and he‚Äôs fairly adept at using his length, but athletic limitations make it difficult for him to recover and block if it isn‚Äôt right in front of him. He‚Äôs assignment-oriented and plays with adequate technique but could be a long-shot to make a roster.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henry-bainivalu/32004241-4973-9938-3b0d-e66c9d62b9e2
Max Duggan,"Scrappy quarterback possessing the attitude, toughness and leadership that teams love. Duggan has proven himself to be capable of overcoming adversity and finding ways to help his team win with his arm or legs. However, he has limited arm strength and frequently forces receivers to break stride on deep balls and crossing routes. Duggan‚Äôs intangibles give him a chance to become an NFL backup but his limitations as a passer cap his ceiling.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/max-duggan/32004455-4756-5396-a842-2d2dca11d19e
Malik Heath,"The size and length are appealing, as is the potential to improve his contested-catch success rate, but Heath lacks the burst to back coverages off or separate consistently against press-man. The ball skills show up on tape, but he must become a consistent ball-winner and play to his size. Heath has Day 3 draft potential.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/malik-heath/32004845-4175-9997-f6a4-fd7ed5c9d90c
Kearis Jackson,"Compact slot receiver with a lack of impressive production but flashes of talent as a zone-beater on intermediate routes. Jackson doesn‚Äôt have early explosiveness into the route, but he builds up speed cruising through open spaces. He‚Äôs not a natural hands-catcher but didn‚Äôt drop many balls and showed an ability to catch through contact in 2022. Jackson needs an accurate passer due to his limited catch radius and jump-ball potential. Given his kick return ability and willingness to get after it as a blocker, he has avenues to a roster spot.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kearis-jackson/32004a41-4328-3549-94a7-36facdca185f
Colby Sorsdal,"Sorsdal spent his college days at tackle but will need to prepare for life as an interior lineman due to his lack of length. He is athletic with good lateral movement and fits a zone-scheme rushing attack. He lacks power and natural core strength, though. Sorsdal will need to get bigger and stronger as bull-rushers had some success bouncing him back into the pocket at times.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/colby-sorsdal/3200534f-5259-3271-426c-f951b26f5956
Jake Bobo,"Bobo is a big slot receiver with below-average speed and agility to separate from coverage. His route running is very patchy, but he‚Äôs fairly tough and competitive when catching around traffic. He has decent hands but a relatively average catch radius. He has some potential as a run blocker in space and might be better suited to add weight and rebrand as a pass-catching tight end.",5.63,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-bobo/3200424f-4255-6112-e781-5b2c8948bd2b
Caleb Chandler,"Highly experienced guard prospect who is more effective protecting the passer than opening run lanes. Chandler plays too straight-legged and with excessive waist-bending, which means he falls forward and ends up on the ground too often. Chandler will struggle to stay ahead of opponents as a move blocker and doesn‚Äôt have the leverage to block with power. In pass protection, he plays with recognition and accurate, quick hands but could struggle to anchor against NFL bull rushers.",5.63,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/caleb-chandler/32004348-4121-7209-1ba0-fe5684a924ea
Jadon Haselwood,"Big possession target requiring work from the slot to create catch opportunities. Haselwood has good size and the strength to make contested catches underneath, but he lacks the speed or separation burst to uncover and stay open against NFL man coverage. His testing could make a difference for him, but a lack of special teams experience could hurt his cause to make it as a WR5/6.",5.63,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jadon-haselwood/32004841-5318-8767-c916-526eb7b90dc4
Durrell Johnson,"Developmental project with intriguing athletic traits and flashes of upside. There is clearly room for additional muscle on Johnson's long, leggy frame, and he figures to become a more skilled player with further coaching. However, he seems to be too willing to stand and watch rather than force his way into the action. Johnson‚Äôs range and potential versatility are alluring features that could serve him well if the play strength and aggression eventually check out.",5.63,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/durrell-johnson/32004a4f-4821-2341-94f0-bd9106c83ba8
Shaquan Davis,"Davis‚Äô size, wingspan and high-point ability are alluring. However, the tape shows a player who fails to play to his best speed and too often struggles to hang onto the football. He has play traits that could be developed, but if he doesn‚Äôt become more urgent and reliable as a pass-catcher, he might not get that opportunity.",5.62,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaquan-davis/32004441-5674-6610-415a-eb0a543fd28f
AJ Finley,"The size and length are appealing, and the ball production is nice, but Finley‚Äôs lack of short-area burst and top-end speed becomes an issue in coverage as well as in pursuit. He can challenge the throw when in position but has trouble getting there on time and creating contested throws. As a run defender, he lacks agility and reactive athleticism in the open field and can be too passive as a tackler. Finley needs to shine on special teams and tighten up the tackling to make it in the league.",5.62,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aj-finley/32004649-4e36-4399-d7ba-a2594296a7de
PJ Mustipher,Mustipher was a high-character leader for the Nittany Lions and brings good thickness to the position. He‚Äôs a little too gradual off the snap to create stress for blockers and fails to control the action with force or hand usage. Mustipher‚Äôs below-average athletic profile and limited impact on games will make it difficult for him to work his way onto an NFL roster.,5.62,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/pj-mustipher/32004d55-5371-7549-899b-f99d88822961
Travis Vokolek,"Vokolek always seems to be in a big hurry, which causes him to play without the technique and body control he needs to maintain consistency at the point of attack. He has great size but lacks the wingspan and hand strength to impose that size as a block-sustainer. Vokolek is a below-average receiving threat, so he will need to improve his technique and his performance as a run blocker to win a spot as an in-line option off the bench or on a practice squad.",5.62,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-vokolek/3200564f-4b42-6541-c240-cd2c6860827b
Keilahn Harris,Slot receiver with below-average traits but solid production over the last two seasons. Harris benefitted from the level of competition and doesn‚Äôt appear to have the elusiveness or elevated ball skills needed to continue producing at the pro level. His experience as a kickoff returner helps him.,5.61,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/keilahn-harris/32004841-5245-3831-5463-ea62c18da65c
Mikel Jones,"Team leader who plays bigger than his listed size. Jones has plenty of toughness and thump behind his pads, but getting off of blocks and making plays against NFL quickness could be too much for Jones to handle. He lacks fluidity and twitch. The game will get tougher for him when it‚Äôs not played inside the tackle box.",5.61,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mikel-jones/32004a4f-4e63-3601-a55e-8edbab1188d0
Paxton Brooks,"Long-levered punter with loads of experience for the Vols. Brooks has modest leg strength relative to many of the NFL punters we see, but he can kick with hang-time and has excellent touch to drop it inside the opposition‚Äôs 20-yard line. Brooks will need to prove he can boom a few punts to create confidence in teams who already like his touch.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/paxton-brooks/32004252-4f15-8746-9bc0-113c743ec027
Jordan Perryman,"Perryman looked overwhelmed in coverage after making the jump in competition to the Pac-12 last season. He has an NFL frame, but he lacks the fluidity and overall coverage instincts needed to stay connected to pro route runners. His physicality could create an opportunity for a safety transition, but he might not be able to make it as an NFL cornerback.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-perryman/32005045-5278-3937-3d43-466b2168eaa1
Brad Robbins,Finesse punter who will be much better at pinning opponents near their own end zone than bailing his team out with power. He punts with much better hang-time than we are used to seeing from college punters and landed nearly half of his punts inside the 20-yard line in 2022.,5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brad-robbins/3200524f-4203-2224-7677-e3e53af0b85e
Chad Ryland,"Five-year kicker with four seasons at Eastern Michigan and one at Maryland. Ryland has the leg to make 50-plus-yard field goals and handle kickoffs, but it is nothing special by NFL standards. He will need to improve his overall accuracy and placement to make an NFL team.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chad-ryland/32005259-4c02-9663-76b8-52ab16a27c3a
Kyle Soelle,"Productive inside linebacker and team leader with a good nose for the football. However, Soelle might lack the speed and explosiveness to play in the NFL. He sees the field clearly and typically diagnoses the action with consistency but when the play forces him to chase in space, it can diminish his finishing consistency. Soelle‚Äôs special teams potential helps, but teams have to buy in on his effectiveness as a backup.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyle-soelle/3200534f-4538-5627-1ffe-301ab474f35f
Leonard Taylor,"Taylor‚Äôs measurables are worthy of NFL consideration, and he‚Äôs more slippery as a pass-catcher than his stats might indicate. While he lined up as a connected tight end at Cincinnati, he will need to improve his core strength to handle NFL defenders across from him. His athleticism could lead to a more expanded role as a pro, but Taylor might need to prove he can take on special teams duties in order to fight for a TE3/TE4 spot on a roster.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/leonard-taylor/32005441-5952-1212-a7b1-c7c2d3c78d72
Quavian White,"White is a feisty cornerback with good ball skills but lacks the size to play outside and the fluidity to match up with shifty route-runners from the slot. He‚Äôs at his best from a side-shuffle technique but won‚Äôt be able to do that inside. He‚Äôs capable in short zone coverages, but that is a very niche scheme to be tethered to and his on-ball production might not be enough to secure a roster spot.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quavian-white/32005748-4939-2527-50da-cdf8e23996a2
Kivon Bennett,"Bennett lacks the desired athletic ability and physical traits of an NFL edge defender. He is a gradual, linear mover with adequate base strength and hand quickness. However, he lacks the traits and suddenness needed to expand his sphere of influence versus the run and pass.",5.59,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kivon-bennett/32004245-4e36-3125-d60d-49ec27d50581
Jerron Cage,"Interior defender with average size, good length and below-average tape. The Ohio State scheme didn‚Äôt ask Cage to make many plays, but he might not have had the play strength or talent to do so if needed. He has decent feet and plays with effort through the snap, but it appears he won‚Äôt be able to control blockers or threaten the pocket often enough to make it as a pro.",5.59,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerron-cage/32004341-4710-2210-835e-901c29e65820
Tavion Thomas,"Bruising downhill runner with size and power but limitations in what he can be asked to do. While he creates yardage after contact, he doesn‚Äôt have the short-area burst or change of direction needed to attack more restrictive fronts on the NFL level. Thomas is a momentum runner who needs to keep his feet moving forward, so inside/outside zone schemes might give him the best chance to make it.",5.59,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tavion-thomas/32005448-4f38-6776-2a29-49a8057e5998
Jack Podlesny,"Podlesny has kicked in some big games, but he missed two attempts in a narrow victory over Ohio State during last season‚Äôs playoff semifinal. He also has a poor success rate on kicks from distance. Consistency and power are key, and Podlesny falls a little short in those areas.",5.58,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jack-podlesny/3200504f-4420-0229-798b-dd398c4ad2b7
B.T. Potter,"Highly experienced kicker who holds multiple school and conference records. Potter generally hits kickoffs with good hang-time and distance for touchbacks. He has a gliding approach and strikes kicks with good consistency, but he has had some issues with mid-range reliability. While Potter has hit 9 of 13 from 50-plus during his career, he‚Äôs missed all four attempts from 55 yards and beyond.",5.58,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/b-t-potter/3200504f-5428-5078-f31e-ed4a9eef1ad3
Jaiden Woodbey,"Woodbey has good short-area quickness and play strength, but he lacks the instincts and burst to make plays that stand out. His speed testing was disappointing, but it appears to match what is on tape at times. He needs to prove he can play fast and will need to star on special teams to have a shot.",5.58,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaiden-woodbey/3200574f-4f25-1349-efce-ae02a3b1627f
Christopher Dunn,"Dunn will need to show NFL teams he can handle kickoffs, as he might not possess enough accuracy and leg to impress clubs enough without kickoff value. He was very good in his first two years and slipped a bit in his next two, but he had his strongest season yet in 2022. He‚Äôs a bit of a long shot to make a team, but his confidence level was where it needed to be last season.",5.57,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christopher-dunn/32004455-4e51-9103-ba6c-b4384d3e6f5a
Christian Young,"Height-weight-speed prospect lacking the football awareness and overall technique needed to step onto an NFL field at this time. Young has the frame to play as a box safety or potentially move to a Will linebacker role, but he must improve his tackling. He has special teams potential, so that could work for him if he gets into a camp.",5.55,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-young/3200594f-5514-8231-db92-94e68bf10e06
Anders Carlson,"Carlson has made kicks in big moments and appeared to be tracking in a good direction back in 2020. However, he has struggled to establish consistency on mid-range kicks and has been poor on kicks from 50 yards and beyond. He‚Äôs had too many kicks blocked during his career and doesn‚Äôt sport a booming leg on kickoffs.",5.54,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anders-carlson/32004341-5211-1222-c169-8362fa35c795
Sean Clifford,"Mobile four-year starter with desired NFL intangibles and leadership, but a lack of passing talent. Clifford will have his moments, but he doesn‚Äôt consistently deliver the ball with accuracy and timing. His arm strength falls below the mark.",5.54,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sean-clifford/3200434c-4904-3683-3aeb-c3acefbb5fe0
Austin Ajiake,"Ajiake lacks ideal size but he‚Äôs fast, explosive and agile. He‚Äôs often too passive in attacking the play, but when he‚Äôs proactive, good things often happen. He‚Äôs never going to be great at taking on blocks, so learning to flow downhill and slip blockers will be critical. He‚Äôs better suited in a chase-and-hit role as an outside linebacker in a 4-3 defense, but his pathway to a pro roster could be centered on his athletic profile and history as a productive special teams contributor.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-ajiake/3200414a-4904-4495-5084-55defac962c7
Deslin Alexandre,"Alexandre is an edge defender who relies on his broad frame and natural power. He‚Äôs long and naturally heavy handed, but he will need to play with much better bend to improve his ability to hold the point against the run. While he‚Äôs a segmented mover at times, he does have quick feet and shows decent pursuit quickness and motor. He‚Äôs a face-up rusher who is unlikely to beat NFL opponents with crafty moves and counters, so fortifying his power rush will be critical as a Day 3 possibility for 4-3 defenses.",5.81,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deslin-alexandre/3200414c-4576-0816-ff50-e111244448dd
Brevin Allen,"Four-year starting edge defender with solid traits/production but a lack of twitch/fluidity to match up against NFL competition. He possesses the power to take on blockers, provided he gets his feet and balance squared away, but he might not have a projectable pass rush teams can count on.",5.58,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brevin-allen/3200414c-4c06-3899-f8c2-f00a2ca014dd
Calvin Avery,"Teams won‚Äôt find tackle-for-loss production or disruption as a pass rusher when they watch tape of Avery, but they will find a wide-framed space-eater willing to battle for his gaps inside. Avery displayed an impressive combination of power and hip explosion at his pro day. He has some bully in him against single blocks but can be a little too straight-legged, which causes inconsistency in his anchor against edge pressure. He‚Äôs an early down, rotational nose tackle but could find NFL work even if he goes undrafted.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/calvin-avery/32004156-4536-7761-b1df-2c164d82c459
Daniel Barker,"Barker is a move tight end with good speed, decent ball skills and below-average consistency as a blocker. While his route running lacks focus and tempo, he does have the ability to get vertical with some success. He makes good adjustments to zone traffic, but he needs to become more combative against man coverage to clear out catch space for himself. Barker is undisciplined as a run blocker and might not offer enough in that department to truly excite teams.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/daniel-barker/32004241-5216-0658-4bc7-b8946189637a
Sy Barnett,"Barnett doesn‚Äôt have the receiving production or pedigree to grab the attention of evaluators, but his pro day performance will push teams to the tape to double check on him. Barnett has a good blend of size/speed in the slot but lacks polish and salesmanship as a route-runner. His hands are agile and fairly sticky. He can threaten on three levels of the field, with his catch-and-run talent adding quick-game value. It‚Äôs worth noting that he was a decent college punter and can handle emergency field goal duties as well. Barnett might be a practice squad candidate early on, but he has intriguing upside.",5.68,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sy-barnett/32004241-5245-4168-e2a7-f5119c86f576
Seth Benson,"Benson has plenty of play strength and toughness. He has no problem handling things when the action stays between the tackles. However, his lack of fluidity and pursuit burst are likely to limit his overall effectiveness as a pro. Benson can play on special teams but doesn't have the tools needed to thrive on third downs. While there is no doubting his ability to take on blocks, teams might see his limited playmaking range as a non-starter.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/seth-benson/32004245-4e64-2217-df2e-1aa7a8accba0
Aidan Borguet,"Borguet is compactly built with a powerful base and an ability to power through arm tackles. While he displays pretty good vision and can get to his cuts once he‚Äôs past the line of scrimmage, a lack of suddenness and excessive dancing is likely to work against him versus NFL speed.",5.61,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aidan-borguet/3200424f-5242-5050-6adf-c0c0f670dc08
Christopher Brooks,"The size and athletic markers are in place to garner some excitement from NFL evaluators, but the tape simply doesn‚Äôt sparkle enough. Brooks is at his best playing downhill for an inside/outside zone concept. He has enough vision and burst to get what is blocked and will run through arm tackles, but he‚Äôs not a physical back by nature and doesn‚Äôt create enough with power. Brooks is capable as a receiver out of the backfield but needs to prove to teams that he can take on pass protection duties to compete for third-down reps. He should find a camp opportunity as an undrafted free agent.",5.63,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christopher-brooks/32004252-4f12-0605-45ae-12dbdf006dbd
Anthony Cook,"Safety prospect with decent size and below average top-end speed. Cook has enough quickness to stay connected to routes, but he fails to play with the route recognition and instincts needed in coverage. He was a more consistent, physical tackler in 2021 and will need to get back to that style of play to give himself a chance to make a roster.",5.62,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/anthony-cook/3200434f-4f00-8248-5338-2efa8e503c33
Michael Ezeike,"Former wideout who is continuing to grow into his frame as a tight end. Ezeike lacks poise and body control getting into his blocks, but once‚Äôs he there, he displays some fight and hand strength to maintain the battle. He‚Äôs not very elusive as a route runner, but he does show decent talent after the catch. He‚Äôs a developmental prospect, but he could find his way onto a practice squad.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-ezeike/3200455a-4522-9501-ab98-b6f99229f971
Chuck Filiaga,"Filiaga isn‚Äôt a great athlete, but he was a capable blocker in Minnesota‚Äôs zone running game, which might end up being a natural scheme fit for him at the next level. He doesn‚Äôt play with much bend, and that leads to consistent leverage issues. He‚Äôs unlikely to drive opponents off the ball as an NFL base blocker. His pass protection is technically sound, but his athletic limitations will create concerns in the pros. Filiaga might go undrafted, but he could eventually make an NFL roster.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chuck-filiaga/32004649-4c47-1005-1612-eb0cdf7a707d
Marshon Ford,"Productive tight end who has posted solid numbers for four consecutive years. Ford is lacking functional size and strength for the position, so he might need a highly specific role that allows him to primarily act as a pass-catcher. He‚Äôs a willing run blocker with decent technique and might have the ability to expand his role as a move blocker in space. Ford has good speed to separate on intermediate routes. He displays good toughness and focus on contested catches. He has Day 3 potential on tape, but size concerns could force him to earn his way as an undrafted free agent.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marshon-ford/3200464f-5228-6735-42e6-ee9778195222
Dillan Gibbons,"Gibbons is a slightly heavy-footed guard-only prospect with two years of starting experience at Florida State after transferring from Notre Dame. While he doesn‚Äôt play with ideal lateral quickness or movement in space, he does a nice job of maximizing his size and strength. His technique is solid in pass protection, but athletic limitations will make it challenging for him to keep sub-package rushers occupied. Gibbons might not be the total package, but he could still find his way onto an NFL roster.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dillan-gibbons/32004749-4207-2102-987c-10c898096e78
Ryan Greenhagen,"Greenhagen moves around the field with hulking arms splayed wide from his frame. He‚Äôs urgent and physical. He plays with good wrap-up strength to finish plays once he gets to a runner‚Äôs legs, but his pursuit speed is limited. He doesn‚Äôt possess the fluidity of movement that will be necessary for open-field tackling and coverage duties as a pro.",5.61,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-greenhagen/32004752-4554-8895-7cf8-7ffb133fea8e
Tre'Shaun Harrison,"Harrison‚Äôs speed and athletic ability are NFL-caliber on tape. While he flashes ball skills at times, it‚Äôs hard not to notice his drops and below-average deep-ball tracking. His route running is unfocused, but he has the physical tools to tighten it up. Harrison‚Äôs easy movements around the field and top-end speed warrant a late-round pick as a developmental prospect.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tre-shaun-harrison/32004841-5264-0340-63a9-373bca3d6607
Griffin Hebert,"Undersized tight end whose speed and fluidity in space basically make him a big slot receiver. Hebert had an excellent pro day, which should put him on the map as a priority free agent. Evaluators could grow to appreciate his mismatch potential and run-after-catch talent the more tape they consume. He needs to play with better effort as a blocker, but his athleticism, explosiveness and speed could make him a developmental project for a team.",5.83,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/griffin-hebert/32004845-4251-9112-c0b1-7ce2e0ea276a
Cooper Hodges,"His temperament and grit play to his advantage and he‚Äôs rarely outworked, but Hodges‚Äô athletic limitations will be challenging to overcome. He‚Äôs not a heavy mover, but he‚Äôs not much of a bender and has trouble sustaining against plus talent across from him. His footwork gets sloppy in pass protection, but that could be improved once he settles in as a guard. He might not be a long-term answer for a team, but he possesses attributes that could give him a chance.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cooper-hodges/3200484f-4435-9304-1999-1804ccf2a1b9
Truman Jones,"Ivy League standout and team captain who brings measurables and athletic attributes to the table. Jones has the size and power to set a firm edge. He plays with savvy to take on blocks and get in on plays. He appears to rush the quarterback with inconsistent play speed and tempo, though. He isn‚Äôt as skilled with his hands as he needs to be, but he plays with the bend and agility to become much better in that area with more work. The step up in competition will be a challenge for him, but he appears to have the traits to compete for an edge rusher spot in camp.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/truman-jones/32004a4f-4e76-9039-8716-b210cb05ff95
Brandon Kipper,"Kipper has played plenty of football and was well-coached at Oregon State. He has the measurables of an NFL prospect. However, he falls below the mark when getting to his landmarks as a move blocker or adjusting to movement as both a run blocker and pass protector. Kipper‚Äôs experience as a right tackle could intrigue teams looking for roster flexibility, but he appears to be a guard-only projection with a below-average ceiling.",5.63,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brandon-kipper/32004b49-5035-5963-2dcf-e6e2808fa011
Garett Maag,"Maag‚Äôs explosive pro-day testing will be much more of an eye-opener than his college film. His tape isn‚Äôt bad, but he looks more like a pass-catching tight end than a big tester when you see him moving around the field as a route-runner. His athletic traits and run blocking help his cause, but he might need to learn to earn a living as a big slot receiver who will make tough, contested catches.",5.67,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garett-maag/32004d41-4112-3857-dc75-d4f9aa94fbd7
Durell Nchami,"Traits-based edge defender with the size, length and athletic ability to warrant consideration as a developmental prospect. Nchami played in just 32 college games and his inexperience shows up on tape. He relies on his physical gifts over technique and instincts, but he could see his play take a noticeable step forward if he can become a more skilled performer. Nchami could use a year on a practice squad, but he might have future value as a 3-4 outside linebacker with rush potential.",5.69,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/durell-nchami/32004e43-4841-5291-be37-080e53f43859
Garrett Nelson,"Nelson is a burly, try-hard edge defender with good power in his hands and an aggressive demeanor on the field. A lack of twitch and short-area quickness limit his effectiveness. Nelson is certainly tough enough to play on the edge, he lacks the ideal athletic profile for the position in the NFL. He might be best suited to play inside linebacker, where he can accentuate his strengths.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/garrett-nelson/32004e45-4c47-0662-2807-e031fc23fa3b
Patrick O'Connell,"O‚ÄôConnell posted elite production in impact categories at Montana, but he lacks the size and athleticism for the NFL game. He plays with good recognition, but he‚Äôs missing the twitch to beat blockers to the spot and the technique/strength to get rid of interior blockers as an inside linebacker. His foot quickness and explosiveness both appear to be below average, but his natural feel for slipping around blockers as a rusher can be fun to watch.",5.6,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/patrick-o-connell/32004f43-4f26-4274-da11-3998f8f008fe
Jacob Slade,"You won‚Äôt see standout measurables or exciting production from Slade, but you will find a squarely built powerhouse with the ability to play with terrific pound-for-pound strength and contact balance. He might need to add more weight to his frame, but he is already tough to move and has the upper-body strength to knock blockers around. He could become a solid NFL backup as a 4-3 nose tackle.",5.95,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacob-slade/3200534c-4117-7376-7c67-fae94dc67d9d
Jonathan Sutherland,"Sutherland played a hybrid safety/linebacker spot for Penn State, with duties ranging from slot coverage to run fits. He posted impressive numbers at his pro day and has above-average special teams production during his career. While he was asked to handle a versatile role, the tape doesn‚Äôt show him shining in any one area. Sutherland will need to find a positional home -- possibly as a nickel/dime linebacker -- to complement his special teams potential at the next level.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-sutherland/32005355-5418-7949-9761-8294c9d1047b
Ryan Swoboda,"Swoboda is a three-year starter at right tackle with rare size that can often work against him due to his high center of gravity. On tape, he has heavy feet and struggles to move them quickly enough to keep pace with athletic movements. However, at his pro day testing, he performed fairly well at the same task. He will need to alter his approach in pass protection with better posture and more efficient hands and feet to overcome the deficiencies he shows on tape.",5.59,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-swoboda/32005357-4f06-9215-9b44-fbad34e0e589
Zeke Vandenburgh,"It might be easy to discount Vandenburgh‚Äôs production as he lacks desired NFL mass, length and quickness off the edge, but his relentlessness and football instincts are worthy of deeper dives for evaluators. He‚Äôs more active than sudden, so he needs to get bigger and stronger to fit a bully role as a pro. He knows how to play the game and finds his way to the football on a consistent basis. Vandenburgh might have a limited ceiling, but he could find his way onto an NFL roster as a backup and special teams performer.",5.82,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zeke-vandenburgh/32005641-4e37-9511-9d22-bc2941272490
Ben VanSumeren,"VanSumeren‚Äôs production and game tape won‚Äôt draw draftable grades, but he possesses extremely rare athletic attributes for his position and that might create an opportunity with a team coveting elite traits. He‚Äôs not a thumper as a run defender and his football instincts leave much to be desired, but if he can prove himself as a special teams contributor in camp, he could force a team to give him a year on the practice squad for additional development.",5.66,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ben-vansumeren/32005641-4e76-0426-3d6d-7a25e721bbe1
Taron Vincent,"Vincent is smallish for the interior and lacks ideal length, but he does show some hand quickness. He needs to be able to play in the gaps and disrupt the blocking scheme, but he appears to lack explosiveness despite his decent lateral quickness.",5.59,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/taron-vincent/32005649-4e41-2665-354c-acf1fe8964a7
BJ Wilson,"A tackle prospect with NFL measurables, Wilson lacks the agility and short-area quickness needed to play outside as a pro. He dominated against inferior competition at times, but he failed to bulldoze opponents due his upright posture in the run game. He will need to become more limber to improve his pass slides and run-blocking consistency, but he faces an uphill battle to make a team even if he becomes a better performer in those areas.",5.64,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bj-wilson/32005749-4c65-0608-bf8d-0b014f7e9ec6
Jake Witt,"Witt‚Äôs athletic testing was off the charts and it helps that teams recognize he is still filling out his long frame. The tight end convert has only been at the tackle position for one full season, so teams understand he‚Äôs going to be behind from an instinct and technique standpoint. He‚Äôll need to make progress as a Year 1 practice squad candidate for teams to continue the investment. He‚Äôs nowhere near ready to play pro football, but he will be a coveted free agent if he goes undrafted given his traits and athleticism.",5.8,2023,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jake-witt/32005749-5436-4970-1de4-f50308ff2d91
